You know what I do is write for the kids, and, in fact, I'm probably the author for kids, more read in America.
And I always tell people I don't want to look like a scientist.
I can <unk> you like a farmer, or with <unk> and no one has chosen a farmer.
I'm here to talk to you today about circles and <unk>
And you know that an epiphany is generally something that fell somewhere in the place.
You just have to turn on the apple to see it like a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of complex circle that I'm going to talk to you.
My circle began in the middle school, in <unk> <unk> where I was the weird class.
When I went to bleed to bleed every week in the bathroom, until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life in letting me get into the bathroom room.
I was doing it in secret.
For three years.
And I had to go out of the city.
He had a thumb, and 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- I found a lover -- and in the 1950s. I felt the need to start working in organizations who fight AIDS.
About three or four years ago, at night I got a phone call from that <unk> Mrs. <unk> who said, "I need to see you.
I'm <unk> that of adults we never get to know us.
You could <unk> <unk> and please bring that man that I know you've already found.
And I have to tell you that I have pancreatic cancer, and I would like you to stand up with this please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
We went to see, we were <unk> <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
We found it a place, the <unk> and the <unk> and we got rid of her family, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because
It's something we knew how to do.
And as the woman I wanted to <unk> as an adult came to <unk> became a <unk> box and was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle had closed, it had become a circle -- and that epiphany of which I told you about it was made in itself.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save her.
And you know that that part of life needs everything that the rest of life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy that today I talked a lot about this.
It also needs -- it needs dignity, love and pleasure. And it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important to me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express humans are not separated from nature and everything is interconnected.
I was for the first time to Antarctica about 10 years ago, and I saw my first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart can quickly, I was <unk> trying to understand what was in front of me.
I would get them around the <unk> of the water almost 60 feet, and I couldn't figure out that it was a <unk> about another <unk> on snow after year.
<unk> are born when you fall out of the glaciers or the ice <unk>
Each iceberg has its own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some of them refuse to <unk> and they hold up to the end, while others can't afford them more and <unk> in a <unk> <unk>
It's easy to think, when you see a <unk> that are isolated separated and themselves, largely as we see us as humans.
But reality is the opposite.
As it melts a <unk> I am breathing its <unk> atmosphere.
As an iceberg melts by <unk> freshwater rich in minerals that feeds many forms of life.
I come up to photograph these <unk> as if it was about the portraits.
It's not death when they're <unk> it's not an end, but a continuation of its way for the cycle of life.
Part of the <unk> ice that I photograph is very <unk> has a couple of thousands of years.
And another part of the ice has over 100,000 years old.
The last few pictures I'd like to show you are from an iceberg that I photographed in <unk> Greenland.
It's a little bit frequent actually get to witness an <unk> <unk>
Here they are.
You can see on the left a little boat.
It's about five meters.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the form of the iceberg and your line of <unk>
You can see here, starting <unk> the boat has moved to the other side and the man is standing there.
This is an <unk> iceberg as an average size.
<unk> from the water about 120 feet or 40 meters.
This video is in real time.
And so <unk> the iceberg shows a different side of his personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time, every <unk> a baby. OK.
So two couples each one with a baby.
I don't want it to be <unk> too much in the details of conception, because if you stop thinking about conception itself, I'm not going to pay attention.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage, I want you to imagine that, in a case, the sperm and sperm joins the X chromosome.
And in the other case, the bone chromosome of the sperm joins the X chromosome from the <unk>
Both <unk> and starts life.
We'll get back to talk about them later.
In my activity in the ground of two <unk>
In one of my <unk> I work with the history of anatomy.
I'm a <unk> by training, and what I study in this case is the way people <unk> the anatomy of the anatomy -- and human bodies and <unk> and how the body fluids are considered <unk> the idea of the <unk> which has thought about the body.
The other role that performance in my work is an activist, like <unk> of patients or, as I say sometimes, <unk> <unk> of people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've been working with people whose physical characteristics defy social norms.
I've been working on, for example, with <unk> twins two people within one of the same body.
I've worked with people who are much lower than the average average.
And I've worked with many instances of people with <unk> sex, individuals whose physical offenders, it doesn't fit into the male <unk> <unk>
We can <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> many shapes.
I'm going to give you some examples of ways of having a sex that doesn't <unk> in the ordinary shapes or <unk>
For example, there is the case of the individual with <unk> <unk> which is that gene <unk> <unk> and it tells the <unk> that we all have in the <unk> life that we all have in <unk> life.
And then, in <unk> life, the testes are going to make testosterone.
But given that this individual owns their body doesn't react to the same.
It's <unk> syndrome.
So, there are high <unk> but <unk>
As a consequence, the body develops in following a female <unk>
When I <unk> the baby has a little girl.
It's a little girl. It's raised as a child.
And often, it's not until puberty, when it's growing and developing breast cancer, but it doesn't have the menstrual cycle, when someone realizes something is happening.
After doing tests realize that instead of having <unk> and <unk> actually has <unk> and a <unk>
The important thing to understand is that you can think about a man, but it's not really like that.
Women, as men, we have in the body something called <unk> <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produced <unk> the hormone <unk>
Most women as I was -- I consider a <unk> woman who doesn't know its <unk> structure, I think being a typical woman most women like me are sensitive to <unk>
We produce <unk> and we respond to <unk>
As a result, someone like me has the most exposed brain to <unk> than the woman who was born with <unk> who has the <unk> syndrome on <unk>
That's why sex is complicated. It's not that <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in some way they can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago, I got a call from a 19-year-old boy who was born and raised as a <unk> I had girlfriend, and she had sex with her, and he had just figured out that he had <unk> and <unk>
It had an extreme form of a disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk>
He had <unk> and the uterus -- the <unk> glands were so active that, in essence, creating a male <unk> environment.
As a consequence, its <unk> were <unk> his brain was exposed to the hormone component typically a male.
He was born with <unk> nobody was born <unk>
And it was 19 years when he started having medical problems caused by the inner <unk> when doctors discovered that in fact, it was a woman inside.
Well, another quick example of a case of <unk>
Some people with chromosomes develop what's known as <unk> which is called <unk> tissue wrapped in <unk> tissue.
We don't know well why it happens.
So, there's lots of sex.
The reason why children with these kinds of bodies -- we have to be <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is not to be able to have a better physical health.
In many cases, people are perfectly healthy.
The reason why <unk> into many surgeries is that they are a threat to our social categories.
The system is based on the idea that a particular anatomy brings together a particular anatomy of identity.
We have the idea that being a woman is to have <unk> identity -- being black means to have an African anatomy in historic terms.
A very simplistic idea.
And when you come up with a body that shows something quite different, we have problems with <unk>
So we have very <unk> ideas in our culture about <unk>
Our nation is based on a concept of <unk> very romantic.
Imagine the amazing thing that is having children born as two people in the same body.
The highest case is last year in the past year with the South African <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk>
Many journalists called to wonder: "What do you test is going to do to determine whether to be <unk> is man or <unk>
And I had to explain to the reporters who don't have such a test.
In fact, we now know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't trace a <unk> line between men and women or between men and <unk> and women and <unk> are us who draw that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more we have the more science and more we have to admit that these categories -- we thought were very stable <unk> categories that are <unk> directly with <unk> categories that are much more <unk> than they <unk>
And not just in terms of sex.
In terms of race, something that is much more complicated than the terminology <unk>
So as we see, we go into a <unk> terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with chimpanzees.
What about the fact of <unk> in just a few <unk>
And as we go into science we get more and more in a <unk> area where we have to recognize that the <unk> categories that are probably too <unk>
And we're looking at this in all walks of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture -- in the United States today, are the struggles at first, and in order to life.
It's hard to set up a moment from which a body becomes human and has different rights to the <unk>
There are very <unk> discussions today <unk> not in public, but I know within <unk> when someone is considered dead.
Our ancestors never had to deal with this question of whether someone was dead.
As a lot of him put a pen in front of the nose and if he moved it still <unk>
If he stopped moving the <unk>
But we can, for example, take vital organs from a body and put them into another body.
And as a consequence, we have to address the dilemma of really determining death of somebody. And this puts us in a difficult situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And you might think that this explosion of categories might be happy to someone like me.
And in politics I'm progressive, <unk> to people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit that I got nervous.
<unk> that these categories are much more fragile than we thought about <unk>
It <unk> from the concept point of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first, I have to admit that I'm a fervent fan of <unk> <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and audacious and so radical in what they did, which I find every bit of seeing that musical <unk> <unk> and not for music, which is totally <unk>
It's what happened in <unk> with the <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> were to me, the first activists on the anatomy and explained why.
What they <unk> was a concept of <unk> and <unk> with another that was radical and beautiful and stayed for 200 years.
And as they all remember, what we would take on with our <unk> <unk> was the idea of <unk> the monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The ones of the old world didn't know the DNA, but they had clear the idea of birth.
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were the idea that it was going to be inspired by political power from the grandfather of the grandfather to father and then to the son, etc.
The parents would have rejected the idea and they were replacing it for a new <unk> concept, and that concept was that all men are created equal.
They <unk> the game field and decided that the anatomy that mattered was the anatomy in common and not <unk> <unk> That was very radical.
And in part they were doing because they're part of a <unk> system where they were <unk> two things.
It was <unk> democracy and at the same time <unk> science.
And it gets very clear, if you look at the story of the <unk> <unk> that many people were very interested in science and in the idea of a <unk> world.
They were <unk> of the <unk> explanations and therefore <unk> the concept of <unk> being passed out of a <unk> idea of birth.
They were moving towards a <unk> concept.
And if you look, for example, the Declaration of <unk> talk about nature and the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And on a result, they were broadcasting the idea of <unk> <unk>
And in doing so, they were <unk> the foundations of the future rights movement <unk>
They didn't think about it, but they did it for us, and it was great.
And what happened next?
And women <unk>
Then the success of the Civil Rights movement with people from the <unk> <unk> <unk> who said, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the rows of Civil Rights movement saying, "I'm a man."
Again, people who are <unk> to the <unk> <unk> about the <unk> <unk> and again, <unk>
We see the same with the <unk> movement.
The problem is, of course, as we look at <unk> we have to start asking ourselves, why do we keep a certain <unk>
But attention, I want to keep some <unk> <unk> in our culture.
For example: I don't want to give a fish the same rights as a human.
I don't want to say that we should <unk> the anatomy.
I don't mean that at five years they should have to have sex or get married.
There are some <unk> <unk> that for me make sense and I think we should be <unk>
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why to keep them and if they make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two <unk> the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in <unk> exactly the same day.
Imagine one of them, Mary, was born three months before time: June 1 in 1980.
Henry, on the contrary, was born in term: was born the March March of 1980.
For the only fact of being born three months before Mary are attributed to all the rights three months before Henry -- the right to the law of sexual consent, the right to vote, the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all of that not because it has a different biological age, but because later.
We found other <unk> in relation to their rights.
Now Henry, in virtue of being considered man -- if I haven't told you if it's <unk> in virtue of being considered a man now is <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Mary, on your hand, doesn't have the same rights to marriage that Henry in all states, for example.
Henry can marry all the states with a woman, but Mary can marry one woman in some states.
So still <unk> categories that in many ways are <unk> and questionable.
And now the question is, what do we do now that science advanced so much in the field of the anatomy that we get to the point of having to admit that a democracy based on the anatomy could be <unk>
I don't want to give up the science, but at the same time, sometimes I feel like science <unk> us.
Where do we go from here?
It seems that what happens in our culture is a kind of <unk> attitude to <unk> "Well, we have to draw the line somewhere, so we're going to do."
But many people remain stuck in a strange position.
For example: Texas at a moment has decided that to marry a man -- you don't have to have <unk> and to marry a woman you have to have the Y.
Now, in practice, they don't do tests to do <unk>
But this is also very strange given the story that I told you at the beginning of the <unk> syndrome to <unk>
If you look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speech "I would love <unk> offers a solution.
It says that we should judge people <unk> not in the color of their skin, but in the content of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yeah, the idea looks pretty good."
But in practice, how do you do that?
How do we judge people based on the content of their <unk>
I want to point out that I'm not sure that we should be <unk> in this to give people rights to people, because I have to admit that I know some of some <unk> <unk> who probably deserve more social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some <unk> that I know can make more intelligent decisions and smart and <unk> about their sexual relationships than I know about.
So how do we put the theme of the content of <unk>
It turns out very hard.
And one part of me asks what would happen if the character of a person could be measured with an instrument, maybe with an MRI.
Do we really want to get at that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that the United States will continue to drive this current thinking in terms of democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy and I think we're going to do a good job in the future.
We don't live in, for example, in a context like the Iranian man who feels attracted to other men is susceptible to be killed unless they are willing to submit to a sex change in which case you can live in.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context like the one of a surgeon that I talked about a couple of years ago that I had made to give birth twins <unk> and then pick up their name.
But when the phone was asked the reason for the operation -- he was a very <unk> operation, he said that in that other country -- these kids would be very <unk> and therefore I had to do it.
And I said, "Well, the political asylum was considered rather than <unk> <unk>
America offers huge possibilities to people to be who are without <unk> to change the state of the state.
So I think we have to be on the head.
Well, to end up I mean, I've been talking a lot about the <unk>
And I want to think about how democracy, or as it might have been, if you had greater involvement in the <unk>
And I want to say something a little radical for a pathogen, and that is that I think there can be different ideas from different <unk> <unk> in particular if there are people thinking about a group.
For years ago, since I've been interested in <unk> I've also been interested in doing sexual difference.
And one of the things that I've been interested in is the differences between men and women in terms of thinking and to operate in the world.
And what we know about <unk> studies is that women, on average, -- not all, but in <unk> tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and care about those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
years ago, when I was in graduate school, one of my advisers who knew I was interested in feminism <unk> I considered myself to <unk> like <unk> made me a <unk>
<unk> what about female <unk>
And I thought, "It's the <unk> question I've ever heard.
Feminism has to do with unpicking the stereotypes of gender, so there's nothing feminine in the <unk>
But the more I thought about the question, the more I've thought about there is something feminine in the <unk>
I mean, there could be something on average, something different from the brain between the female brain and the male that makes us more <unk> and complex social relationships to help the most vulnerable.
So if the parents were very aware of them, they were very aware of how to protect people in the part of the state, you might be able to have more <unk> to this concept, maybe we would have enriched the concept of protection with the <unk>
And maybe that's what we have to do in the future when we make democracy beyond <unk> thinking less in the individual body, in terms of identity, and thinking more about relationships.
So while we're trying to create a more perfect <unk> let's think about what we do for each other.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided we had to rethink how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks where it wants to go to live and work, have the possibility to choose between the least a handful of different cities that are competing to attract new residents in their own.
Well, right now, we're far away from that target.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't have a single city willing to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that they are worth a lot more than its cost to build.
So we'd easily be able to <unk> the world -- perhaps hundreds of new cities.
Well, this might sound absurd if you have never thought about new cities.
But they just spread out for buildings from apartments.
Imagine that half of those who wanted to live in apartment they would be owners and to the other half still to do it.
You could try to increase the ability to <unk> all the existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that <unk> is that those buildings and the areas around us have rules to avoid <unk> and causing them to build.
So it would be very hard to do all those <unk>
But they could go to a whole new place to build a new apartment building -- totally new, always and when the rules of that place would build up the construction rather than putting <unk>
So I proposed that governments were going to <unk> new reform zones to contain cities and gave them a name for <unk> cities.
I later learned that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of Honduras.
Did you know that every year about 75,000 <unk> will come from their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009, <unk> went through a Chinese constitutional crisis.
In the next election elections, we <unk> <unk> <unk> a platform in which we <unk> reforms and at the same time reconciliation.
He asked <unk> who was his head of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk at TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a great amount of evidence with users, I tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk> to their most essential.
The first point was the importance of the norms, like those rules that tell you that you can't go and pick up all of the current residents from apartments.
It takes a lot of attention to new technologies, but it takes so much of technologies like <unk> <unk> and usually the rules that keep us going forward.
In the fall of 2010, a <unk> friend sent to <unk> a link to the <unk>
I showed it to <unk>
They called me.
They said, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we met in Miami, in a conference room in a hotel room.
I tried to explain to you this point about how valuable the cities are, much more valuable than their cost of <unk>
And I used this picture that shows the value of land in a place like New York City, which in some cases, are worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract discussion and at some point, when there was a pause, he said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
And the talk described in very simple terms that a city under <unk> is a place where you start with <unk> terrain that <unk> the rules that are <unk> there and a choice so that people can choose if they want to go or not live under those norms.
So the president of <unk> I called to me and told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this could be the way that our country is going forward.
He asked me to be <unk> and I would talk about four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included an image like this, which I was trying to explain that to make a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that built in <unk>
Only this airport is covered over 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, you have to start with a place that is measuring at least 1,000 square miles.
That's over 100,000 acres.
Everybody <unk> <unk>
The people in the public were very serious and <unk>
The Congress leader came up to the platform and said, "Professor <unk> thank you for his talk, but maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
I have this here in my <unk>
So I sat down and showed the <unk>
And this explained <unk> that a new city can offer new choices for people.
There would be a choice of a city where they could go to be in <unk> rather than hundreds of miles away from the North.
And we also <unk> new choices for leaders.
Because the leaders of the <unk> government would need help from <unk> countries, they could benefit from the countries associated with the <unk> that they would help them establish and make the <unk> norms so that they could all trust that the <unk> actually <unk>
We went and saw a site.
This picture is there.
It could be just a thousand square miles.
And shortly after that, the 19th of January, they voted in Congress to <unk> his Constitution and add a constitutional arrangement that allow you to create these special regions of development.
In a country that had just gone through this <unk> crisis, the vote in the Congress in favor of this constitutional <unk> was <unk> to one.
All of the parties, all the <unk> in society, the <unk>
To <unk> in the Constitution, You have to pass twice in Congress.
On February 17 was passed over to another voting -- from <unk> to one.
Immediately after the voting -- 21 to 24 in February, a <unk> <unk> <unk> was the two places in the world that are most interested in building in the building of cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new big center of the city that is building in Korea, is bigger than the center of Boston.
Everything you see there was built in four years, after spending four years getting the <unk>
The other country in the building of cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've already built two cities in China and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about this <unk> this is the point where we are.
They have a place, and they're already thinking about a site for the second city.
They're preparing a legal system that would allow the <unk> <unk> and at the time it would allow them to operate under an external legal system.
A country has been committed to allow his Supreme Court to be the last instance for this new <unk> system.
There are urban <unk> <unk> cities that are very interested in the project.
They can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know you have figured out is that they have a good number of inhabitants.
There are a lot of companies that wanted to be installed in <unk> especially in a place with a free zone, and there are a lot of people who would like to go to live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would immediately change somewhere else.
There's a million a year that comes out of Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to leave their family back to their family to get a job, sometimes they're mothers who have to earn their money to just eat or buy clothes.
Unfortunately, sometimes even there are children who are trying to meet with their parents who haven't seen, in some cases, in a decade.
So what does it look like to think about building a new city in <unk>
Or build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these all over the world?
What seems to you thinking about insisting so that families can choose between various cities that are competing to attract new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends were asked to say, "Thank you TED <unk>
I'm a <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what in the inside, I'm going to make a radical confession -- and that is that, I live obsessed with <unk>
I love to find, <unk> and more recently, to photograph and post my blog and colorful and different <unk>
But I didn't buy anything new.
All my clothes is from the second of <unk> markets and <unk>
Oh, thank you.
The second hand stores allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment and my <unk>
I go to meet people <unk> usually my money is going to be a good <unk> My aspect is <unk> and buying it becomes my personal search for <unk>
I mean, what am I going to find today?
It will be my size?
"I love <unk>
It will cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive, so I feel that I've won.
To go back to the theme of my <unk> I want to tell you what I <unk> for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what brings the entire <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I was doing.
I brought seven pairs of inner clothes, and nothing else.
<unk> inside exactly a week is all I put in my <unk>
I thought I would be able to find everything else that I'd like to use after I got to Palm <unk>
And because they don't know me as the woman walking through TED in inner underwear,  -- that means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the sets for this week.
It doesn't sound interesting?
While I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that, believe it or not, I've learned in this journey of not using new clothes.
Let's start with Sunday.
I call this tiger tiger
You don't have to spend a lot of money to see it.
You can almost see it <unk> for less than 50 dollars.
All the together, including the <unk> it took me <unk> and it's the most expensive thing I've used in the week.
<unk> the color is energy.
It's almost <unk> impossible to be <unk> when you're wearing a bright red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy people.
<unk> <unk> is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
I just know yourself.
If you get rid of the right people, it's not just <unk> you will be <unk>
<unk> <unk> of the kid who are wearing inside.
Sometimes people tell me that they seem to play <unk> or I remember their little <unk>
I like to <unk> and say, <unk>
<unk> trust is the key.
If you think you do well with something, it's almost sure you are.
And if you think you don't do well with something, it's probably true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until the 30 years I really understood its meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person in your interior and outside, there's no look that you can't <unk>
So there's no excuse for anyone in this audience.
We need to be able to do everything we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> A universal truth for you, <unk> <unk> are going with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a personal style to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tested it again and again when people came up with this week just because of what I was using, and we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously this is not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I went home, to Brooklyn, I'm going to give you everything.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn this week is that you have to leave certain things out.
I don't need <unk> I don't need these things, because around the corner, I'm always going to be another crazy suit and <unk> and bright <unk> if there's a little love in my heart and after.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can divide in two parts.
The left side, which is the logic and the right side, which is the intuitive.
So if you take a scale on a scale to measure the <unk> of each <unk> we could design a blueprint for our brain.
For example, this would be someone who is completely logical.
This would be somebody who is totally intuitive.
So where do you get your brain at this scale?
Some <unk> by one of these extremes, but I think for most of the members of this audience, their brain is something like this -- with a great <unk> in both <unk> at the same time.
It's not to be mutually <unk>
Can you be logical and intuitive.
I consider myself one of those people, which just like most of the other quantum physicists, we need quite a lot of logic to make them very complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need a lot of intuition to make experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We can play with them and then we see how we <unk> and then we developed our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
As many intuition that you can have developed over the time of the years is that one thing can be just one place at a time.
I mean, it may sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this <unk> <unk>
I remember watching a kid playing on a parking <unk>
It was a little kid, and I didn't do it very well, he always <unk>
But I bet you play with that bar bar <unk> he taught a valuable lesson, and it is that the big things don't allow the <unk> and that stay in a place.
This is a great conceptual model that you can have in the world, except to be a particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist, because they don't play with parking <unk> they play with these strange particles.
And when they play with their particles, they discover that they do all kinds of things really weird -- like they can go through walls, or they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called the quantum mechanics.
At that point there was the physics a few years ago; you needed of quantum mechanics to describe these little particles.
But you didn't need to describe the big objects around us every day.
That didn't fit very well for my intuition, and maybe it's because not very often with particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not too much.
And I've never seen it.
I mean, never anybody saw a <unk>
But it didn't fit well for my logic.
Because if everything is made of small particles and all the little particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, then it shouldn't all follow the principles of quantum <unk>
I don't find the reason why it shouldn't have been.
And so I would feel much better if I could somehow prove that a common object also follows the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object you can see has been in an overlap of quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.
That's the little bit of metal that I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is an image of the object.
And I'm going to zoom in a little bit. It's right in the center.
And then we do a very big approach approach to the small metal <unk>
What we see is a little bit of metal, with a springboard and a springboard and <unk> on a platform.
And then I did this almost sort of a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a new silicon chip -- and I put all the big machines around about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this hole with a swimming <unk> which is underneath the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum overlap but it needs some help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how uncomfortable being on an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I am on an elevator alone, I do all kinds of weird things, but then when other people come up to do those things, because I don't want them to <unk> or actually <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
The trip of inanimate objects are not just people -- it's also the light that <unk> and the wind that happens to their side and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little bit of metal would be <unk> according to quantum mechanics, we'd have to throw all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
<unk> the lights, then <unk> a <unk> and pulled out all the air, and then it <unk> it at a temperature of less than a degree on the absolute zero percent.
Now, when you're just in the <unk> the little piece of metal is free to act like it.
So we measure their movements.
We found it was moving in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, he was vibrating. and the way that he <unk> was like a breath in this way -- like a <unk> that expands and <unk>
And by giving him a soft <unk> we were able to make it <unk> and that don't take the same time -- something that just happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is something really fantastic.
What does it mean is that a <unk> thing and not <unk> at the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In a case, every trillion atoms making up that piece of metal are still still and at the same time that same atoms are moving up and down to the bottom.
It's just in certain <unk> when those are <unk>
In the rest of the time they're <unk>
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which means that all the metal piece is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Seriously.
<unk> <unk> in a clean room to do this for all those years, because watch this, the difference on scale between one atom and that piece of metal is more or less the same kind of metal that little bit of metal and you.
So if a single atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that piece of metal can be in two different places, why not you as well?
I mean, it's my logical part of speech.
So imagine if you were in several places at the same time, how would it be that?
How do you act your consciousness if your body was <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it's when we got it, and we turned out the lights and look inside the box, we saw that the metal was still there in one piece.
And I could get to this new intuition, seemingly all the objects on the elevator are actually just quantum objects that are just <unk> in a small space.
You hear a lot about that quantum mechanics is <unk> it's all interconnected.
Well, that's not so true.
It's more profound than that.
It's that those connections, your connections to all the things around you, literally define who you are, and that's the deep queerness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And 18 months ago, I was doing another job on Google, until I launched the idea of doing something related to museums and art to my boss, and that allowed me to do it.
It took me 18 months and it took me.
A lot of negotiations and stories are <unk> with 17 very interesting museums in nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on the <unk>
There's a lot of stories of why we did.
I think my own story is just explaining just on this slide and this is access.
I grew up in India.
I had a great education -- I didn't get <unk> but I didn't have access to many of these museums and artwork.
So when I started traveling and go to museums, began to learn a lot.
And working on Google, I try to make the desire to make it more accessible through technology.
So we formed a team -- a great team of people, and we started doing it.
And better that shows the demo to explain to you a couple of interesting things that we've done from their launch.
So, <unk> we're going to <unk>
Look around all the museums that are.
There's the gallery gallery at MoMA, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In fact, I'm going to go into one of my favorites, the <unk> the art museum in New York.
There are two ways to do that -- very simple.
We click and <unk> we are in the museum.
It doesn't matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that doesn't really matter.
You move around and <unk>
They want to navigate the <unk>
We opened up the top plane, and with one click, we jump inside.
They're inside, they want to go at the end of the hall in the hall in the room.
You go ahead. They get <unk>
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't got the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The <unk> of Pieter <unk> in the <unk>
I see the <unk> sign.
If the museum shows us the picture, we click there.
Look, this is one of the images.
Here's all <unk> information.
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click this right now.
And this is one of the images that we've captured in what we call the <unk> technology.
So this picture, for example, <unk> I think, about 10 million pixels.
And there are a lot of people who ask me, "What do you get in 10,000 million <unk>
So I'm going to show you what you really get with 10,000 billion pixels.
You can zoom in in a very simple way.
You see some fun things that are happening.
I love this guy, his expression has no price.
But if you really want to <unk>
So I started playing play, and I found something that was going on there.
And I said, "Wait a moment, this seems <unk>
I walked into it, and I discovered that kids were actually playing something.
So a little bit, I talked to some people from the <unk> and I actually discovered that this is a game called <unk> which is to hit a <unk> with a Tuesday <unk> stick.
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get further into depth and you'll see that you can actually get into the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to take the image, so you'll really see what there is.
This is where we were, and this is the painting.
The best thing is for coming, a second.
So now we're quickly going to jump over again at MoMA in New York.
Here's another favorite of my favorites, "The night <unk>
The example I showed was to find details.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how Van Gogh actually created this work <unk>
It goes up and really <unk>
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this picture, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is <unk>
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite features here.
There's a lot more things over here, but I don't have time to <unk>
This is the really cool part -- it's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely no matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that gives the same.
You can online create their own museum, create their own collection from all these images.
It's very simple, and I created this function that I call "The <unk> of the <unk> -- we just made a zoom in.
This is "The <unk> at the National Gallery in London.
You can write things, send it to your friends and keep a conversation about what you feel when you look at these <unk>
So in conclusion, I think for me, the main thing is that all the amazing things really don't come from Google.
No, in my mind, even they don't come from the museums.
Maybe I should not say this.
They actually come from those artists.
And that's been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital medium it does justice to its work of art, and that is represented properly online.
And the great question that I'm doing today is, "You have to do this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good afternoon everybody.
So I have something to show you.
Think of it is a <unk> a pixel <unk>
In our lab, we call it sensitive design.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I'm from Italian <unk> all the kids in Italy grow with this picture on the wall of his bedroom. But the reason I show you this is that has happened something really interesting about careers in year careers in the last two decades.
Some time, if you wanted to win a career of Formula 1 took a budget and put it into a good pilot and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot were good enough, you did the race.
This is what we can do is that, in engineering, the system of control system in real time.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
Now what's interesting is that the real control systems are starting to enter our lives.
Our cities, over the last few years, have been covered with networks and electronics.
They're becoming open computers to be <unk>
And, as a <unk> they're starting to respond differently and they can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is a big thing.
As I note aside I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the Earth's cortex -- but they represent 50 percent of the <unk> population.
75 percent of the consumption of <unk> and to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with the cities, it would be a big thing.
Beyond cities, all these <unk> and <unk> are entering into our everyday objects.
This is from a <unk> exhibition for the end of MoMA, in MoMA, during the summer.
It's called <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, start to <unk>
In a way, it's kind of like almost all the existing atoms that were <unk> <unk> <unk>
And that's completely changing the interaction that as humans have with the outside environment.
In a sense it's almost like the old dream of Miguel <unk>
You know, when Michelangelo <unk> <unk> is said that at the end he took the hammer and put it on the Moses -- you can still see a little dent in <unk> and he said, <unk> <unk> <unk> and he said, <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just a little bit <unk> <unk> in the idea of getting the environment and push something.
Let's start with the detection of the <unk>
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects of our lab.
This was four years ago in Italy.
It was a summer hopefully 2006.
It was the year that Italy won the World Cup the year.
Maybe some of the remember -- playing Italy and France, and at the end of the day, he gave the <unk>
And anyway, at the end I won Italy.
Now let's see what happened that day by looking at <unk> activity in the network.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the river <unk>
It's the morning, before the game.
The line of time is at the top.
At the late afternoon there are people around here and doing a phone call out there.
It starts the <unk> silence.
<unk> from France.
<unk> people make a quick call and go to the toilet.
Second time. End of time.
First time <unk> a second.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
<unk> Italy, yeah!
That night all went to <unk> at the center.
You see the big <unk>
The next day they all went to the center of the winning team and the prime minister then.
And then everybody <unk>
You see the image of the place called <unk> <unk> where, since the time <unk> people are going to <unk> it's a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we couldn't do just a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> is not about people, but about things we use and consume.
Today we know everything about the provenance of our objects.
This is a map that shows all the chips that make up a Mac, how do you get <unk>
But we know very little about where things are.
So in this project, we developed some small tags to track the trash in its shift through the system.
We started with some volunteers who helped us in Seattle a little bit more than a year ago to tag what they were <unk> different kinds of things, as you can see, things that are all <unk>
Then we put a little chip, a little chip on the garbage and then we started <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
From <unk>
after a week.
With this information, we realized that there are a lot of <unk> in the system.
We can do the same with much less energy.
These are data that didn't exist before.
They're going on complicated things, and there's lots of <unk>
But the other thing we think we think is that if we see every day that the cup that we <unk> it not simply vanishes, and it's still somewhere on the planet.
That if the plastic bottle we throw a day is still there.
If we show that to people, then we can promote some change of behavior.
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague at MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us much more about detection and lots of other great things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part that we talked at at the very beginning, which is to push over the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple years ago in <unk>
It all started with a question of the mayor of the city, who came and told us that Spain and south of Europe have a beautiful tradition of the use of water in public space in the architecture.
And the question was, how can technology do technology, new technology, to join that?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT, in a workshop was, imagine you have a <unk> and <unk> valves <unk> <unk> that open up and <unk>
It creates like a <unk> of water with water.
If you go down the pixels you can write on them, show patterns, images, texts.
And when you zoom in, the curtain will open so that we can happen, and you see in the image.
We presented this to the mayor <unk>
He liked it a lot.
And we had a commission to design the building to the entrance to the <unk>
We call it a <unk>
The whole building is made of water.
There is no windows and no windows -- but when you approach it is open so you can see it.
The ceiling is actually covered with water.
And if there's a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> the ceiling.
Or you can close the building and all the architecture is gone.
There will always be somebody, in the winter, when you go down the roof, when he was there, and he said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not that you've got it, but when it comes down almost all the architecture is gone.
Here it is running.
You see people <unk> what happens inside.
And here I'm myself trying to do not <unk> the sensors that open the water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was really even more fun.
All the kids from <unk> came to the building because the way we interact with had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that opens up to leave you up, but a building that was still doing <unk> and holes in water and one had to jump out of <unk>
<unk> <unk> And for us that was very interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, we always think about how people will give our designs.
But then reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things that people use.
This is a picture of the building with the <unk> the pixels of water, and of projections over them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could begin to fly.
Imagine you could have little helicopters in the air and each one had a small pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud that moves in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, like the one we saw before, that moves with others in synchrony.
Could we form this cloud, we could be.
A kind of flexible screen like this with a normal configuration in two dimensions.
Or normal, but in three dimensions, where what changes is light, not the pixel position.
You can play with a different type.
Imagine that the screen appear in different scales and sizes, in different kinds of resolution.
And then all that could be a cloud of pixels in 3D the one that you can get anywhere near and <unk> and see from very different perspectives.
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like before.
When the light lights off, you see this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine each of them controlled by one person.
We can have each pixel with an input that comes from people, the movement of people, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best dancers dancers of today, the star of New York City and <unk> <unk> to capture their movements in 3D and use them as input for the <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left you see the <unk> you see it in different <unk>
It's so <unk> in real time as a movement capture.
You can <unk> all the movement.
You can go all the way.
And once we have the pixels we can play with them, with color and the movement, with gravity, and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible input for the <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project that we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called <unk>
And the idea is, imagine that we could get people involved in order to do something and change our <unk> environment as a <unk> farm as the <unk> <unk> but with a cloud.
Imagine that we could make everybody <unk> a little bit for a <unk>
And I think the remarkable thing that has happened in the last few decades, is that, in the last two decades, we moved from the physical world to the digital world.
We have digitized everything like knowledge, and it's accessible to the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign -- we can move from the digital world, from the <unk> power of the networks, the physical world.
In our case, this may we want to use it to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow can be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change, or CO2 emissions, how will we move from the digital world into the physical world.
The idea is that we can make people involved in doing this together, in a collective way.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels in the same way that the real cloud is a cloud of particles.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud they're pixels.
It's a physical structure in London, but covered the pixels.
You can move inside, have different experiences.
You can see from the bottom, it's going to be to share the main moments of the 2012 Olympics.
So it's so much a physical cloud of the sky as something that you can go up, like a new top of London.
You can get into it there.
As if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is that it will be a new experience for anybody to go to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than they are <unk>
Suppose I told you that, with just a lot of changes in their genes, they could improve the <unk> for a more accurate accurate and faster.
Or maybe you would like to be in better way, to be more <unk>
Would you like to be more attractive and make sure of themselves?
How about living more with good health?
Or maybe be those people who always wanted to be more creative.
What do you most <unk>
What would you like if you could choose something?
<unk> from the Audience: <unk> <unk>
How many people are going to do creativity?
Raise your hand. Let me see.
<unk> Probably the number of creative people present.
That's very good.
How many people want <unk>
A few more.
And the <unk>
A little less.
How about <unk>
Oh, the majority. That makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have some of this the world that would be very different.
It's just <unk>
Or maybe that is possible?
Evolution has been a theme here at the TED Conference.
The great <unk> of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> that also <unk> in the Church of <unk> <unk> wrote a trial titled "Nothing in biology makes sense of the <unk> light.
But if they actually accept biological evolution to consider this: it's just the past, or the future?
Is it about others or us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, well on one end, it is, of course, the most interest that we're interested in.
<unk> of a common ancestor with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago.
There's been maybe 20 different species of <unk>
Some have gone and <unk>
We have been here about <unk> years old.
It might seem like that we are very far from other parts of this tree of life, but actually in most of the basic machinery of our cells is more or less the same.
You realize that we can leverage and control the machinery of a common bacterium to produce the protein of human insulin protein that is used to treat <unk>
This is not as human insulin -- but it's the same protein, <unk> <unk> from the <unk>
And talking about bacteria -- they realize that we all carry in the <unk> bacteria than the cells that we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think of -- when Antonio <unk> gives you the <unk> they think about <unk>
The gut is a wonderfully <unk> environment for those bacteria.
It's hot, dark, wet, it's very <unk>
And we're going to provide all the nutrients that can want to want no effort to their part.
It's really like a fast path for the bacteria with the occasional occasional <unk> of the <unk>
But by the way, we're a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential to our life.
They help them digest nutrients to <unk> and they protect us from certain diseases.
But what about the future?
We are in an evolutionary balance as a species?
Or to become something different, something maybe better adapted to the <unk>
In this vast symphony of the universe, life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, as one single and only human life, a small note of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk so I hope you've got it.
When I just <unk> college I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by the elegance and the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution and realized something fundamental -- in most of the existence of life, in the <unk> organisms each cell just divide and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitting to the two lung cells.
But when organisms appear to <unk> things begin to change.
It goes into the scene of sexual reproduction.
And something really important -- with the emergence of sexual reproduction that passes the genome, the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, you could say that the <unk> of the body of the body becomes evolution in the same moment of sexual reproduction.
I have to tell you that when I was a college student, I thought, well, <unk> <unk> death -- it seemed quite reasonable at that time, but with every year that was happening, every time I had more <unk>
I got to understand the feelings of George <unk> who still <unk> in Las Vegas in his 90s, in his 90s, <unk>
And one night someone hits your door in a hotel.
He opens the door.
In front of it, he finds a gorgeous dancer.
And he looks at it and he says, <unk> in pursuit of a <unk> <unk>
"Okay, <unk> says George, "I choose <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working on a different goal to the goal of <unk> not necessarily <unk> just different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted you to get healthy <unk>
I wanted to get health into the disease.
I wanted them to live more and healthier.
Evolution is to pass the genome to the next <unk> adapting and generation generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view, you and I are like <unk> rockets designed to send the genetic load to the next level, and then let us fall into the sea.
I think everybody <unk> the feeling that put Woody Allen when he said, "I don't want to achieve immortality through my work.
I want to <unk> you not <unk>
Evolution doesn't necessarily apply to longevity.
It doesn't necessarily hurt the biggest or the louder or the faster and even the most intelligent <unk>
Evolution favors the best creatures adapted to their environment.
That's the only trial for survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean of the <unk> bacteria that can survive the heat of the <unk> that would be <unk> if there were fish there, fish <unk> but then they've managed to do that a <unk> environment.
So what does this mean when we look at what's happening in evolution and if we go back to thinking about the place of humans in evolution and in particular, if we look ahead, the <unk> phase, I would say that there are many possibilities.
The first one is that not <unk>
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the underlying reasoning would be that through medicine, first of all, we've known to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and <unk> from the population.
And secondly, as a species, we have <unk> our environment for us as well as we adapt to it.
And by the way, <unk> <unk> and we are so excited that it is no longer possible to have the isolation that evolution happened.
A second possibility is that there's a traditional kind of evolution -- natural type, dictated by the forces of nature.
And the argument here would be: that the gears of evolution roll slowly, but they're <unk>
And as soon as we <unk> as a species, distant planets are going to exist the isolation and environmental changes that can produce evolution in a natural way.
But there is a third possibility, a fairly attractive possibility -- intriguing and frightening.
I call my <unk> new evolution, which is not just <unk> but <unk> and elected for us as individuals in the decisions that we <unk>
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get to do this?
We first consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing to have more males than women.
It's not necessarily a good thing for society, but it's what you choose to do is the individual and family level.
Think about it as well as possible to choose not only sex on its own <unk> but in your own body to make the genetic <unk> to cure or prevent disease.
And if we could make climate change to get rid of diabetes or Alzheimer's disease or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate <unk>
Don't want to do these changes in your <unk>
If you look at the future that kind of changes is going to be more and more possible.
The Human Genome Project started in 1990, and she sued 13.
<unk> <unk> million dollars.
The next year of being done, it could do the same job for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a full sequence of the three billion base pairs of the human genome -- at the cost of a cost to the <unk> and in a whole week.
Not too much to make the human genome reality by <unk> and getting more and more to the scope of all.
These changes.
The same technology that has produced human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not only going to protect themselves but they are going to induce <unk> against other viruses.
<unk> or there is no experimental trial in the course of the vaccine against <unk> <unk> cells in a <unk> plant.
Can you imagine a good thing coming out of the <unk>
That's reality today and the future is going to be more and more possible.
Imagine then only another two little <unk>
They can change the cells of their bodies but if they could change the cells of their <unk>
And if you could change the sperm and the <unk> or change the newly <unk> egg -- and give their children a better chance of a healthier life, to eliminate diabetes, to reduce the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want children more <unk>
And then, that same <unk> technology, that same engine of science that can produce changes to prevent diseases that are going to allow us to also adopt <unk> a better memory.
Why not have the ingenuity of a Ken <unk> especially if you could <unk> with the next generation of the machine <unk>
Why not have a faster muscle muscle that allowed us to run faster and more <unk>
Why not live longer?
This is going to be <unk>
And when we're in conditions of passing this up to the next generation and we can embrace the attributes that we wanted to have turned the evolution of before in <unk>
We're going to take a process that normally could take 100,000 years and we can <unk> it to 1,000 years and maybe happen in the next 100 years.
These are choices that their grandchildren, or the grandchildren of their grandchildren, are going to get to them.
We're going to use these options in a better society, more successful, more successful.
Or, we're going to choose to selectively <unk> that we want for some of us but not for the others?
We're going to build a society that's more boring and more robust or more robust and more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And the deepest thing of all: we're going to be able to develop the wisdom and inherit the wisdom necessary to make these <unk> decisions.
For good or for worse, and before what it might be, these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a big explosion when you're at 900 feet tall when you're at 900 feet high.
Imagine an airplane full of smoke.
Imagine a motor doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> sounds terrifying.
Well, I had a single seat that day -- I was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only one I could talk to you with the flight flight.
And so I looked at them, and they said, "No problem. You probably hit some <unk>
The pilot already had <unk> the airplane, and we weren't so far.
You could see it a <unk>
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot <unk> the airplane with the Hudson River.
Often that is not the road.
He <unk> the motors.
Imagine being on an airplane and not <unk>
And then he said three words ...
The three <unk> words that you've heard.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to talk more with your flight <unk>
I could see it in his eyes.
It was terror. Life is <unk>
I want to share with you three things that I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in a second.
We have this list of things to do before they die, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people I wanted to get and didn't, all the fences that I wanted to do and I didn't do, all the fences that I wanted to have and never <unk>
While I thought about that later on, I was a sentence, which is, <unk> wine <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm going to open.
I don't want to <unk> nothing in life.
And that urgency, that purpose, really has changed my life.
The second thing I learned that day -- and this is while I was <unk> the George Washington bridge, which was not a long -- I thought about, wow, I really feel a great <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity, and my mistakes I've tried to do in everything I did.
But in my humanity also gives place to my ego.
And I'm sorry about the time that we <unk> in things that didn't matter to people that matter.
And I thought about my wife with my wife, with my friends, with people.
And then, as a <unk> in that, I decided to remove the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels like <unk>
I don't try to have <unk> <unk> will be <unk>
The third thing I learned -- and this is like your mental clock is going to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You see the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please <unk>
I don't want this to break down in 20 pieces as you see in those <unk>
And as I <unk> I had the feeling of, wow, dying is not fear.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for that all of our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to <unk> I love my life.
And that sadness <unk> in a single thought, which is, I just wish one thing.
I wish I could see my children growing up.
One month later, I was in a performance performance of my daughter -- first grade, not a lot of artistic talent -- <unk>  And I scream, <unk> like a small kid.
And to me, that was the whole reason of being the world.
At that point, I got to connect those two points, that the only thing that matters in my life is a great father.
All of all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good father.
I was awarded a miracle of not dying that day.
And I gave myself another gift, which was the possibility of looking at the future and to live in again.
You who are flying today, the challenge to imagine that the same thing happens in your airplane -- and please not be this -- but imagine, how do you <unk>
What is it that <unk> that they still expect to do because they think they're going to live <unk>
How do they change their relationships and negative energy in them?
And most importantly, they are the best parents who are <unk>
Thank you.
I've clearly been <unk> in life with many projects.
But the most cool thing I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> in the '80s.
He came to his house after running and said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Today <unk> has complete <unk>
It can only use your eyes.
His work influenced me.
I have a design firm and animation company so I have a graffiti of graffiti and so I have a intricate thing that we admire and <unk> in the art world.
So we decided we were going to <unk> <unk> <unk> and his cause.
So I went and met her brother and father and I said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are you going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "I just want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with him and he's able to communicate with me."
And I said, "A second is not that <unk> seen Stephen <unk> it's not that all people with paralysis can communicate through those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you're important to be important -- you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do they communicate then?"
Did anybody see the movie "The <unk> and the <unk>
They communicate in that way, they're going to make it <unk>
I said, "That's <unk> How can it be?"
So I showed up with the just wanting to get a check, and instead of that signed a check that I didn't have the least idea of how I was going to <unk>
I was <unk> with his brother and father there at the very moment, "OK, this is the <unk> Tony is going to talk, we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to go back to making her art again.
Because it's ridiculous that someone who has so much inside their inner can't <unk>
So I talked about a conference a couple of months later.
I met these guys called <unk> Research Research -- which have a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface and then with a laser pointer that are drawn on that and record negative space.
So they go around making art facilities like this.
All of the things that they <unk> they say, they're part of a life cycle.
They first start with sex organs, then with the bad words, after the Bush attacks and the end, people start to make art.
But there was always a life cycle in <unk>
And so the journey began.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a year later, after a lot of organization and so much to move things from one side to another we had a couple of things.
One, we touch the gates of the insurance companies and we got a machine so that we could do a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, is the most <unk> I call it <unk> because when you talk to the guy with the guy you get an email from him, and you say, "Don't <unk> This guy's <unk>
The other thing we did was to bring seven programmers across the world to <unk> every corner of the <unk> to our home.
My wife, the kids and I, we moved to the garage garage and programmers and programmers and programmers and <unk> and <unk> took control of the house.
Many of our friends thought we did something completely stupid and that when they were <unk> they would have taken off the frames of the walls and they would have <unk>
But for two weeks -- <unk> we went to the shipping ride. My son was part, my dog too, and we created this.
It's called <unk> <unk> and you can see the <unk>
They are a couple of <unk> sun glasses that we buy in <unk> <unk> Beach, some copper wire and <unk> and Radio <unk>
We take a <unk> camera, we put it together on an LED light, and now there's a device that is free -- and it builds one itself, we published the code <unk> the software goes down in free.
And we created a device that has no limitation at all.
There's no company that I would say "No."
There's no hospital that I can say "No."
Any person with paralysis today has access to draw and communicate using only their eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much to you. That was awesome.
So at the end of the two weeks we came back to the <unk> room.
I love this picture because this is the room of another person, and that's his room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the big opening.
And then over a year of planning, two weeks of planning, intense days of training all night, Tony came back to draw for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system of his life and is looking through the support system.
We ran the bed so I could see.
We put a slide on a wall of the parking wall outside of the hospital.
And he came back to draw for the first time in front of his family and friends -- and you can imagine what was the feeling in the parking lot.
The funny thing was that we had to bust in the parking lot, so we felt like we were <unk> the graffiti as well.
At the end of this he sent us an email and this was what he said, "This was the first time that draws in seven years.
I felt like I had been under the water and someone finally came to <unk> and get me out there so that I could do it.
It's not <unk>
In a way, that's our scream for war.
That's what keeps us in motion, <unk>
And we have a long way to go through this.
It's a great device but it's the equivalent of a <unk> <unk>
Someone with this artistic potential deserves a lot more.
So we're trying to figure out how to figure it out and make it faster and robust.
Since then we've had all kinds of recognition.
We've gained lots of awards.
Remember, none of us are making money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
The prizes were <unk> "Oh, this is <unk>
Armstrong <unk> something about us, and then, in December, Time magazine recognized as one of the 50 best inventions of 2010, and it was really cool.
The best thing about all of this -- and this is what ends up closing is that in April of this year in the Los Angeles <unk> in downtown Los Angeles there is going to be an exhibition called <unk> in <unk>
And <unk> in the <unk> is going to have the best <unk> in urban art -- <unk> <unk> <unk> -- they're all going to be there.
<unk> is going to be on the show -- which is pretty impressive.
So, basically, this is my idea: if you see something that's not possible, do it possible.
None of what is in this room was possible -- the stage, the <unk> the microphone, the <unk> nothing was possible at a moment.
Make it <unk> anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I never did anything with <unk> technology, I just recognized something and <unk> me with wonderful people to be able to make it happen.
And these are the questions that I want us all to do every day when we're going to find out with something that we feel like I have to do.
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years in which I've spent really hard situations and at the same time so much dangerous to do.
I went to the <unk> difficult.
I worked in a dangerous <unk> mine.
Film in areas of <unk> difficult and dangerous.
And I spent 30 days eating only this -- fun in the beginning, very dangerous in the middle, very dangerous to the end.
In fact, in much of my career, I've been focused on situations in the appearance of horrible situations.
So when I knew that I was going to do a TEDTalk on the world of brands and <unk> I wanted to do something a little different.
So some of you may have heard of them, or not, a couple of weeks ago, I took an <unk> on <unk>
I sent some messages on Facebook, some Twitter volunteered to the name of my TEDTalk TEDTalk in 2011.
What I had was this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk that you have no idea what it is and according to content could be <unk> in the face, especially if I put it in ridiculous to you or your company to do it.
But I said this, it's a very good opportunity to go.
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a degree in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew someone was going to buy the rights of the name.
If you had asked me a year ago, I hadn't been able to <unk> for certainty.
But in the new film that I'm working on, we looked at the world of marketing for <unk>
And as I said earlier, I've been stuck in horrible situations in the last few years, but nothing could be <unk> it could be <unk> for something that is so dangerous or as dangerous as you go into the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
Morgan <unk> I want to do a film that tries to do about the <unk> of products, marketing and advertising, and that all of the film was <unk> with <unk> and marketing and advertising.
The movie is going to call "The largest film ever <unk>
What happens in "The largest film ever <unk> is that all of the top at the bottom of beginning to end, he has <unk> all the time; from the <unk> that appears before the title -- the brand <unk>
Now this brand, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people were <unk> in film to <unk> forever.
And so the film explores all of this idea. <unk> <unk> is <unk> Is it <unk> Is it <unk> A <unk>
I'm a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> just <unk> it was more <unk>
It was <unk> <unk>
But we're not just going to have the <unk> sponsor in the title but we're going to make sure that we would take all the categories that we can in the film.
Maybe you get a shoe and it becomes the most great shoe that you <unk>
The most great car that you've driven in "The largest film ever <unk> the best <unk> you have <unk> from "The largest <unk> movie.
<unk> <unk> The idea is then also to show the brands as part of life, making them <unk> the <unk> <unk> to make the <unk> MS: And we actually showed the whole process of how it works.
The actual goal of the film is transparency.
You're going to see the whole process in this film.
That's the complete idea -- the whole shot of beginning to end.
And I would love to help you to help make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear that -- it's the most respect for the audience.
<unk> though, I don't know how <unk> is going to be the people at that.
<unk> You have a <unk> -- I don't know if you <unk> it's very <unk> but you know how to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> How much money does you need to do this?
MS: A million and a half <unk> <unk> -- very <unk> John <unk> I think it's going to be hard the meeting with them, but certainly it's going to be worth convincing a couple of <unk>
<unk> Who knows, maybe for the moment that movie comes out, we will look like a lot of <unk> <unk>
MS: What do you think is going to be the answer?
Stuart <unk> Most of the answers will be "No."
MS: But it will be hard to <unk> by the film or to be I?
JK: So both things.
MS: That means you're not very optimistic.
So I <unk> I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> Awesome.
MK: We have to think about what brands.
MS: Yes. <unk> That's the <unk> When you look at the people that you have to <unk>
MK: We have some places where we go. <unk> <unk> <unk> the camera.
MS: I thought that <unk> meant having a conversation out of a microphone.
<unk> the camera means "We don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And so it was, one of these companies disappeared.
No one wanted to have anything to do with this film.
I was shocked.
They didn't want to know about this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought the concept of advertising, was to introduce the product to as many people as possible, to make so many people as possible.
Especially in the world today, this intersection of new media and old media and the stage of the separate media scenario is not the idea to count with that new vehicle that is going to lead the message to <unk>
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you see, my idea had a <unk> error and that error was this one.
Actually no, there was no such mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been fine.
But the problem was what this image.
See, when you look for images of Google in Google <unk>   This is one of the first images that were introduced.
I like your <unk> Sergey <unk> No.
This was the problem: <unk> free of simulation or <unk> easily <unk> or <unk> easily <unk> which is characterized by the visibility or access of information, especially in the practices of <unk> being the last line perhaps the biggest problem.
You see, we heard a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians <unk> President <unk> even <unk> <unk>
But suddenly when it comes to a reality when it comes to make it a suddenly.
But why? Well, transparency day <unk> --  -- like that weird bear that is still <unk>
It's <unk>   Like this weird <unk>
And it's also very risky.
What else is it <unk>
<unk> a whole bowl of <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started talking to companies and tell you that we wanted to tell this story and said, "No, we want them to have a <unk> story.
We want you to take a story, but we want to <unk> <unk> story."
See, when I was a kid, and my father stood up in a lie in some lie -- and there he was looking at me as a single <unk> said, "Son, there are three sides in history.
It's your story, it's my story, and it's the <unk> story.
As you see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with just a company, an agency wanting to help me -- and that only because I knew John Bond and Richard <unk> of many years -- I realized I would have to go for my own, I would have to take off as a proxy and go to companies myself with all my team.
So what I started to see suddenly -- and I started to give me <unk> is that when you start talking to the companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends who make big, enormous, giants and others that make small films like mine.
And my friends who make Hollywood film movies say that the reason their movies are so successful because of the brands associated with the brands associated with them.
And then my friends who make independent films say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant movies of <unk>
And the film is called "The largest <unk>
How are we going to see specifically <unk> in the movie?
Every time I'm going to go out, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any time during an interview with someone I can say, "Are you fine for this <unk>
You're ready? You get a little nervous.
I want to help you <unk>
Maybe you should put a little bit of this before <unk>
And then you offer one of these <unk> <unk>
Both <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> are going to have its opportunity.
We're going to have so much for man like for <unk> solid, <unk> in bar, whatever.
That's the general look.
Now I can answer your questions and give you a look at <unk>
Karen Frank: We are a small brand.
We <unk> the kind of smaller movies we <unk> we're more well a <unk> brand.
So we don't have the budget that they have other brands.
So doing things like that, you know, remind people to be the reason why we're interested in.
MS: What words would you use to describe <unk>
<unk> is in white.
<unk> That's a great question.
Woman: <unk>
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you put in the <unk>
Man: We talk about something <unk> <unk>
I think <unk> is a great word that really puts this category in positive versus <unk> smell and <unk>
It keeps it cool.
How do we stay fresh <unk> better <unk> more <unk> three times <unk>
Things like those who <unk> the benefits.
MS: And that's a <unk> company.
What about me? What about a common <unk>
I need to talk to the man of the street, to the people like me, to the common <unk>
They have to tell me about my brand.
MS: How they define your <unk>
Man: <unk> my <unk>
I don't know.
I like good clothes.
Woman: revive the 1980s, <unk> <unk> unless it is <unk>
MS: All right, what is it <unk>
<unk> Something unique. <unk> <unk> Man: I guess the kind of gender, the style I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
I like a lot of dark colors, a lot of gray colors and things like that.
Usually as I wear <unk> or <unk>
Woman: If Dan was a brand that could be a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 2: The brand I am, I call it <unk> <unk>
Woman 2: I'm part <unk> partly <unk> in part <unk> <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the kind of pets.
They bring toys for pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my <unk>
In my little sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand was FedEx because he <unk> the <unk>
Man 5: <unk> <unk> failure.
Is that anything?
<unk> I'm a <unk>
<unk> I'm a <unk>
MS: Well, not all of us can be <unk> but I often <unk> at the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed someone who could go into my head, someone who could help me understand what they call the <unk> <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that <unk> personality.
If you could do it for them, they could surely do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the photos, right?
MS: Yes. The first picture is a familiar photograph.
A: surprised me how it relates to your thoughts and feelings your way of being.
MS: These people form my way to see the world.
A: Tell me about that world.
MS: That world -- I think your world is the world that we think about as the people around you, your friends, the way you live your life, the way you live your life, the work you do.
All of those things come from and start in a place and in my case they come from and start in my family in West Virginia.
A: What's the next one you want to talk about is a <unk>
MS: The next one is "This was the best day of my life."
A: How does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and how to be?
MS: It's like who I wanted to be me.
I like the different things.
I like the weird things. I like the rare things.
A: Tell me about the <unk> why do we do that?
What's the <unk> What phase is <unk>
Why is it important <unk> What is the <unk>
Tell me a little bit about that.
A little bit more than you, not who you are.
What other <unk> have you <unk>
You know, you don't have to fear. What kind of mountain rollercoaster are you?
MS: <unk> <unk> Thank you. No, thank you.
A: thanks for your patience, <unk> Great <unk> A: Yes. <unk> Thank you very much.) All right.
MS: Yes, I don't know what's going to come out of this.
There was a lot of crazy things around this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing I saw was this idea that there are two different sides -- but <unk> on your personality of <unk> the brand Morgan <unk> is a <unk> brand.
They were <unk> very well together.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I think some companies will only be <unk> in one of their strong dots or the other instead of focusing on both.
A lot of companies tend to be -- and it's nature -- to avoid the things that are not <unk> to avoid fear, those elements, and you are actually <unk> you get something positive for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands are this?
The first here is the classic Apple.
And you can see it also here to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are <unk> brands and brands of mind, those things that have gone and come in, but a <unk> brand is quite powerful.
MS: <unk> <unk> What's your <unk>
If somebody asks you to <unk> your brand, your <unk> your <unk> what would that be?
You're a <unk> <unk> you're somebody who makes blood <unk>
Or you are more a <unk> <unk>
A little bit more <unk> <unk> <unk>
The attributes of <unk> are like being playful as it will be playful as <unk> contemporary <unk> <unk> <unk> or bold as <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> magical or mystical as <unk>
Or you are more of the <unk> <unk>
You're conscious, sophisticated as <unk>
You're <unk> traditional <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You're reliable, stable, <unk> safe, <unk> <unk> or wise as the Dalai Lama or <unk>
In the course of this film, we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said, <unk> didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mostly because they wouldn't have control, you wouldn't have control over the final product.
We were allowed to tell the story of the <unk> and we got to tell the story in this film of how it now uses MRI to identify the centers of the wish in the brain both for commercial marketing as a movie for commercial <unk>
We went to San <unk> where they have <unk> <unk>
All over the city over the last five years, there is no <unk> there is no <unk> no <unk>
And we went to school districts where companies are getting way into schools in schools in the U.S. issues in America.
The amazing thing to me is that the projects in which I've had the biggest answer or the ones I've had more success is those where I interacted with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
<unk> the <unk> took off their agencies, and they said maybe these agencies have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to deal with the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that's going to do to think about people, which is going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how has it gone?
Well, since the movie was sent out in the <unk> Festival <unk> Let's take a look.
According to <unk> the movie was released in January, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million impressions in the media for this film.
This is just a two-year period of two weeks and a half.
That's just in <unk> no press and TV.
The movie is still not <unk>
It's still not online. It's not in <unk>
It's not even presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has already begun to make momentum.
And it's not wrong -- it's almost all of the agencies that we talked about to <unk> their clients will not be part.
I've always believed that if you take risks, if you take risks, that in those risks are opportunities.
I think when you get out to the people of that are pushing the failure.
I think that when you train your employees at the <unk> at risk is preparing their entire company to stop rewards.
I feel that what has to happen is that we have to encourage people to <unk>
We need to encourage people to have no fear of opportunities that can be <unk>
Ultimately, going on, I think we have to give it to fear.
We have to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear. <unk> the risk.
From a <unk> at the time, we have to embrace the risk.
And ultimately, we have to keep transparency.
Today more than not a little honesty is going to go a long way.
And I said this, with honesty and transparency, my whole talk <unk> the <unk> has been presented by my good friends of <unk> who would have bought the rights of the name in <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data in great opportunities for businesses around the world.
<unk> presents <unk> <unk>
Thank you very much people.
June Cohen: So I said, <unk> in the name of transparency, that happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: It's a fantastic question.
In my pocket I have a check for the name of the TED organization, the <unk> Foundation -- a check, for <unk> to be applied to my aid for TED year.
The idea behind the <unk> worm is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their biggest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the <unk> plant.
The gray boxes that you see are systems of control in real time.
If we can compromise these systems that control the speeds and <unk> we can cause a lot of problems with <unk>
<unk> boxes don't use software <unk> they're a completely different technology.
But if we were able to put a cash virus to Windows in a laptop use by an engineer to set up this gray, then we're ready.
This is the plan behind <unk>
We started with a <unk> Windows.
The <unk> enters the gray box, <unk> <unk> and the Iranian nuclear program is <unk> mission.
It's easy, <unk>
I want to tell you how we discover this.
When we started researching on <unk> about six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing that you knew is it's very, very complex in the part of the <unk> the <unk> using multiple <unk> <unk>
It seemed to want to do something with these <unk> boxes -- these control systems.
That struck us the attention, and we started an experiment in which we had our environment with <unk> and we saw what happened to this.
So they spent very weird things.
<unk> <unk> like a <unk> rat that he didn't like our <unk> the wave, but I didn't want to eat.
It didn't make sense for me.
And after experimenting with different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, "This is a <unk> attack.
It's completely <unk>
The <unk> is actively looking at the gray box if you find a specific configuration, and even if the program that is trying to infect is effectively working on that place: <unk>
If not, <unk> does nothing.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because we said, "We don't know what the <unk> is.
It might be, for example, a power plant, or a chemical plant in Germany.
Better than <unk> the goal soon.
And so we pulled up the code, and we figured out the attack, and we found that it was <unk> in two <unk> <unk> and a small one.
We also saw that they were very <unk> people who obviously had all the internal information.
<unk> all of the points to attack.
You probably even know how much they would <unk> the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you've heard that <unk> <unk> is complex and high technology, let me tell you the payload is very complex.
It's very above everything we've seen before.
Here you see a sample of this code of attack.
We're talking about 15 thousand lines of code.
It looks pretty much the old <unk> language.
I want to tell you how we could find sense of this code.
What we were looking at was called the functions of the system, because we know what they do.
Then we were looking at <unk> and data structures and tried to <unk> them with the real world, with the real real world.
We need theories that we can pass on or <unk>
To get to theories about goals, we remember which is definitely a violent <unk> must be a <unk> <unk> and it's probably located in Iran, because it's where most of the infections has been <unk>
They don't find a lot of thousands of targets in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear power plant and the <unk> plant.
So I told my <unk> <unk> a list of all the experts in <unk> and plants between our <unk>
I called them and I told them in an effort for <unk> their experience with what we find in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate the little digital <unk> with the control of the <unk>
The rotor is that piece of mobile part inside the <unk> that black object you see.
If they run the speed of this <unk> they certainly can <unk> and even make the <unk> <unk>
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow and <unk> in one obvious effort to get back to the nest engineers so that they couldn't solve this quickly.
We tried to figure out the big digital <unk> looking very close to the data and their structures.
So for example, the number <unk> shows up in that code, you can't <unk>
I started researching scientific literature on how these <unk> are built in <unk> and I found that they're <unk> in what's called a <unk> and every waterfall contains <unk> <unk>
That made sense, there was a coincidence.
And it got better.
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts called stages.
And guess what we find in the code of <unk>
A pretty <unk> structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had in your hands.
So that wasn't <unk> it wasn't like this.
The results have been made after a lot of hard work.
We were going to get out of dead ends.
And yet, we discovered that both digital digital <unk> would say to one single one, but from different perspectives.
The small <unk> is taking a <unk> and making these <unk> and <unk> and the big <unk> communicates with six water <unk> and manipulating <unk>
In <unk> we're very confident that we've determined what the <unk> is.
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We should not worry about other goals are <unk> by <unk>
So here I show you some very interesting things that we saw -- I really <unk>
That's the gray box and the top you see the <unk>
What this thing is doing is <unk> the <unk> values of sensors for example, of the pressure sensors and the vibration sensors and provides <unk> which is still running during the attack, with false data.
And believe it or not, these fake input data are <unk> by <unk>
It's kind of like Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security camera is fed with video <unk>
Is this great <unk>
The idea here is obviously not just <unk> to the operators of the <unk>
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security.
We need digital security systems where a human operator could not act fast.
For example, in a power plant, when the huge steam turbines are flowing down, you've got to open <unk> in a <unk>
Obviously, this can't be a human operator, right?
That's where we need digital security.
And when they're <unk> then they can go through bad things.
The plant can exploit.
And no <unk> no security system <unk>
That scares me.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
It has nothing to see, specifically, with <unk> with <unk> <unk>
It could work as well, for example, in a power plant, or a <unk> factory.
It's <unk>
And you have no <unk> to disseminate this burden with a <unk> <unk> as we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use conventional technology of worms to <unk>
<unk> as possible.
And if you made that, with what <unk> is with a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence we have to face.
Unfortunately, the largest number of targets for such attacks is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and Japan.
All green areas are very large spaces of goals.
We need to face the implications, better than we start to prepare now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has been public in many sides that people assumed that the <unk> is the main entity behind this.
What's your <unk>
Ralph <unk> Okay, really want to hear this?
Yeah. <unk>
My guess is that the <unk> is involved, but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is <unk>
There's one alone, and that's the United States, luckily, <unk>
Because, in another way, our problems would be even larger.
CA: Thanks for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
I want you to imagine a robot that can be able to carry on and give <unk> skills or somebody else that makes chairs of wheelchair get up and come up and walk.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
They're not different than something that gets in the morning, gives you a great force, which also increases its speed, and help, for example, how to drive the balance.
It's actually the real integration of man and the machine.
But not only that -- it can integrate and connect with the universe and with other <unk>
This is not a <unk> idea.
So to show you now what we're working on, we started talking about the American soldier who, on average, must take on their back a burden of 45 pounds, and it's <unk> to take even more equipment.
Obviously, this leads to some important complications -- injuries on their back, at 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic damage to the back.
We decided to look at this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help manage the matter.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> -- or <unk> <unk> Human <unk>
Soldier: With the exoskeleton <unk> I can <unk> 90 pounds of variables for many hours.
Their flexible design allows you to put in <unk> <unk> and running <unk>
<unk> what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then it increases my strength and my resistance.
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this device this new <unk> this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
So let's go back to the users of chairs of wheels, on what I feel particularly passionate about.
There are 68 million people on the chairs of the wheels, all over the world.
Like one percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative calculation for it.
We talk about something that happens very often, young people with damage to the spinal column that when they start their life -- at 20, 30 or 40 or 40 or 40 years -- they collide against a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be their only choice.
We also talk about the population that gets <unk> quickly.
His only option, many times -- for a brain injury, or some other <unk> is the wheelchair.
And this has been that over the last 500 years, since its successful <unk> as I must recognize.
So we decided to start writing a new chapter on mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who 19 years ago had a injury in the neocortical column, and as a result, he couldn't go back for 19 years, so now.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> that <unk>
It has some sensors.
It's completely not <unk> in the crutches who send signals on the board on board on the back.
There's also a few batteries that give power to the motors at <unk> and on the knees, and they make it forward with this soft, very natural <unk>
AB: I was 24 years old at the top of my life when, by a strange jump in the air, skiing down the bottom was <unk>
In a fraction of a second, I lost all feeling and all movement from <unk> down.
Shortly after later, a doctor came into my room in the hospital, and he said to me, <unk> never <unk>
That happened 19 years ago.
So I stole all the way up to the last bit of hope of my being.
The technology of adapting since then, has allowed me to learn how to <unk> it costs to <unk> climbing rocks and even riding on <unk>
But they haven't invented anything that allowed me to walk, so far.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have technology, we have the platforms to sit and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change life to future generations -- not just soldiers, but Amanda, and all the users of chairs of the wheels, all of the chairs.
AB: Thank you.
I just came back from a community that has the secret to human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> practice sex to say hello, and the game is the order of the day -- where the fun thing is serious.
And no, it's not the <unk> Man festival or San Francisco.
Ladies and gentlemen, they know their cousins.
This is the world of the wild Bonobos of forests in Congo.
The bonobos are, along with chimpanzees, their closest living relatives are.
That means that we all share a common ancestor an evolutionary grandmother, who lived about six million years ago.
Now, the chimps are known for their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've made a lot too emphasis on this way in our narratives of human evolution.
But the bonobos show us the other side of the currency.
Whereas the chimps are dominated by big, <unk> the society is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special -- because this leads to a very tolerant society where the deadly violence is still not <unk>
But unfortunately, the bonobos are the least <unk> of the great apes.
They live in the depths of the forest, and it's been very difficult to <unk>
The Congo is a <unk> a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of the <unk> <unk> scenario of a violent conflict that has been <unk> for decades, and caused almost as many deaths as the First World War.
It's no wonder that this destruction will also put the survival of the Bonobo.
<unk> meat and deforestation would be able to not fill a stadium with the bonobos that are in the world -- and honestly, we're not quite sure about it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos you can hear the laughter hidden the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know them like the ape <unk> love, not <unk> because they have <unk> sex, <unk> and <unk> to drive conflicts and solve social problems.
I'm not saying this is the solution to all of the problems of humanity because the lives of Bonobo is more than the <unk> <unk>
<unk> like humans, love to play throughout their entire life.
Play is not just a game game.
For us, the game is fundamental to establish ties and encourage <unk>
We learn to <unk> and we learn the rules of the game.
The game increases creativity and resilience, and it has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of diversity of diversity of behavior, diversity of connections.
And when you look at the game, Bonobo sees the roots <unk> same of laughter, the dance and the human ritual and the humans.
The game is the glue that comes together.
I don't know how you play you, but I want to show you a couple of unique videos from the wild species.
First, it's a game <unk> game, and I don't talk about football.
Here we have a female and a young male in the middle of a <unk>
Look at what's doing it.
It could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase, "It's <unk>
I just think that in this case, he loves him, right?
Yeah.
So the sexual game is both common in bonobos as in humans.
And this video is really interesting because it <unk> this video is really interesting because it shows the invention of bringing unusual elements into play -- like <unk> and also how play requires trust and <unk> <unk> and at the same time is the most fun.
But play is <unk>
The game is <unk> it can take a lot of forms, some of which are more <unk> <unk> <unk> maybe the place where the wonder.
And I want you to <unk> this is <unk> a young female woman, who is playing with a <unk> water.
I think, like her, sometimes we play ourselves, and explore the limits of our inner and outside of our inner worlds.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, to interact. And then the unexpected connections we form is the real <unk> of creativity.
These are just little samples of the realization that Bonobos give us our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future in which we have to adapt to a world increasingly difficult to more creativity and more cooperation.
The secret is that play is the key to these capabilities.
In other words, the game is our <unk> of <unk>
To adapt to a world that changes have to play.
But let's take a lot of our ability to game?
The game is not <unk>
The game is essential.
For bonobos and humans, it's not just cruel and <unk>
When it looks at least in play, they can be the moments that is the most urgent thing.
So <unk> primates, let's accept this gift of evolution and play together as <unk> creativity, <unk> and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York I'm responsible for developing a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I'm not fighting poverty, <unk> fires like a captain of a captain in a <unk>
And in our city, where volunteers tend to evolve a highly skilled staff to get to the fire site very soon to get into action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer on the site, so I had a pretty high probability to go.
But there was still a race to foot against the other volunteers to get to the captain of the captain and figure out what our task was.
When I found <unk> I was <unk> in a conversation with the owner with the owner that certainly has been through one of the worst days of his life.
We were in full night, and she was standing outside in the rain, under a <unk> <unk> while his house was on fire.
The other volunteer that I had just got before me, <unk> <unk> <unk> --  came first to the captain and he asked him to fit into the dog's dog's dog.
The <unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There was a lawyer or a <unk> of money that, for the rest of his life, I would have to tell the people who walked into a <unk> building to save a live alive because I won it for five seconds.
Well, I was the next one.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need to have the house.
I need you to <unk> <unk> the fire, and it brings this woman a pair of shoes."
I promise you.
It wasn't exactly what I was hoping but <unk> I got up the stairs, at the end of the hall, went to the <unk> firemen that measured more or less had ended up on the fire and entered the main room in search of a pair of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my <unk> <unk> where I met my <unk> and the lovely dog on the front door.
<unk> from the house the treasures of the house where, as it was to wait, her trove got a lot more attention than mine.
A few weeks later the department received a letter from the owner of the owner of the house to save the <unk> effort to save his house.
And the kindness that she looked at for about everything else was that someone had just reached a pair of shoes.
Both in my calling in Robin <unk> as in my calling of volunteer <unk> I am witness in the acts of generosity and kindness on a <unk> scale, but also acts of grace and courage to the individual level.
And you know what I've learned?
Everything has its importance.
So when I look at this room to people who have done, or are by getting -- remarkable levels of success -- I would like to remind you to remind you this: I don't hear it.
Don't wait for the first million to make the difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give, I will get you now.
<unk> food in a dining room, <unk> a neighborhood park.
Are they mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the chance to save someone's life, but every day we're going to influence someone's life.
So we trained the <unk> <unk> the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, you come back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem strange, but I'm a big fan of the concrete block.
The first concrete blocks were built in <unk> with a very simple idea, modules of a fixed measure that fit together with each other.
Very quickly, these became the <unk> construction unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build bigger things than we, as buildings or <unk> a brick at a time.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, to <unk> came up with this.
It was called a <unk>
And in a few years, the <unk> brick came to every home.
It's estimated that they've been over 400 billion or 75 brick per person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build bridges or homes.
<unk> made it accessible.
<unk> simply adopted the concrete block in the world, and it became a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in the Bell labs the next revolution was about to <unk> the new building block.
The transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of aesthetic <unk> piled on each other to a world where everything was interactive.
Just like the block of it, the transistor allows you to create a lot bigger and more complex circuits a brick at a time.
But there's a <unk> <unk> the transistor was just to experts.
I personally don't understand that the building blocks of our time are getting to experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I began to explore the idea of bringing the power of engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started developing <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronic modules each with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound, motors and sensors.
And the best thing about it is that they're linked by magnets.
So you can't get in the wrong way.
The bricks have a colored code.
The green is the <unk> the blue is the stream, pink is the input and the orange color is the wire.
So you just have to assemble one blue with a green one, and very quickly you can start to make bigger circuits.
A blue one with a green light makes light.
We can put a button in the environment, and we have a <unk>
If we change the button for a strain module.
We <unk> this <unk> to create more impact and we have a noise.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are actually very powerful.
Instead of having that program, connecting and <unk> <unk> allows us to program using very simple <unk>
To make <unk> faster or slower -- just this button that makes the pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it's an increasing collection.
We want all the interactions in the world to go into brick to <unk> ready to use.
<unk> sounds, solar panels, <unk> everything must be accessible.
We have given kids to see them playing with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best thing is how you start to understand the electronics of every day that you don't learn in schools.
For example, how it works a light at night, or why the door of an elevator is <unk> or how an iPod responds to touch.
We've also led to design schools.
So for example, designers don't have some electronics in electronics begin to play with <unk> as a material.
Here you can see, with bottles of paper and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
A few weeks ago, we took the Cambridge School of Rhode Island, who have no expertise in engineering, just wood and paper <unk> and we said, Make something.
Here's an example of a project that has done, an <unk> barrel of <unk>
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> made out of <unk> which is <unk>
For these no engineers, <unk> became another material, the electronics became another material.
And we want this material to be at the scope of all.
So <unk> has open source.
You can visit the website, download all the design files and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world we live, this interactive world is ours.
So ahead and <unk>
Thank you.
I'm going to tell you today about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar technology.
And my little company is looking for to get involved with the environment.
<unk> collaboration.
This is a little video of what we do.
<unk> Wait a moment.
You can take a little bit of <unk>
<unk> we can continue to get the video next to one side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
The solar technology is ...
Oh, I'm like, <unk>
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago, I launched a initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything we are supposed to do, we asked them to work in the government.
The initiative was called <unk> for <unk> for <unk> and would be like a <unk> <unk>
I took some members every year, and we put them to work with the <unk>
Instead of sending the Third World <unk> we send it in the wild world.
They made great <unk> they worked with employees <unk>
Their task is to show the possibilities of current technology.
<unk> <unk>
It's a <unk> in the city of Boston.
Here it shows up as if I look for a quote, but what it really is looking for is that somebody has caught up when it is caught in snow because you know it's not very good by putting fires when it's covered by a meter of snow.
How did it come to ask for the help of this <unk>
Last year, in Boston we had a team of members of <unk> for <unk>
They were there in February and at that moment -- I spent a lot of last year.
They realized that the city is never wiped out these <unk>
But one of the members of members called Erik <unk> I noticed something else: that citizens will <unk> the sidewalks right in front of them.
So he did like any good programmer, I developed an app.
It's a nice application that you can take a <unk>
You accept <unk> when you <unk>
When you do that, you put a name, in this case he put it <unk>
If you don't, somebody can be <unk>
I mean, it has a <unk>
It's a modest application.
It's probably the smallest of the 21 applications of the last year.
But it does something that no other technology of the government <unk>
And it goes viral.
One responsible for <unk> city systems when you see this application realized that he could use it, not for the snow, but for citizens to have <unk> <unk>
It's very important that these <unk> <unk> but people <unk> the batteries.
That's why the citizens of <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make citizens <unk> <unk> <unk>
And Chicago just <unk> to make people <unk> to clean sidewalks when they <unk>
So now we know about nine cities that are using using it.
And this has spread <unk> in a natural and natural way.
If you know a little bit of government technology, you will know that this doesn't happen.
<unk> software acquisition takes a couple of years.
Last year, in Boston we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool for the parents to be able to choose the best public school for their children.
Then we were told that I had done the normal channels it would have taken at least two and a half million dollars.
And that's nothing.
Now there is a project in the <unk> court of California that the time has spent 2.5 million dollars and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this at every level of government.
So an app that shows in a couple of days and it spreads in viral shape is kind of a warning to the institution of government.
It suggests to the world's best ways to work, not as in private companies as many people think it should be.
Not as a technological company, but more well as the Internet itself.
I mean, without <unk> in the open form and <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that it represents the way to address the question of the government that has the new <unk> not as a problem of an <unk> institution -- but as a collective action.
And that's very good because it turns out that we are very good for collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools so that they are building together with efficacy.
And it's not just <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people all over the country that contribute to applications -- every day in their own communities.
You haven't given up with government.
They feel a great frustration to do that, but they don't have the <unk>
And these people know something that we've lost in sight.
And that is that if we leave the feelings about politics, the line in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all of those other things that you put out crazy -- the government is essentially the words of Tim <unk> "What we do together because we don't have alone yet.
Now, a lot of people have abandoned the government.
If you're one of those people, I would ask you to get it, because things are changing.
The politics is not <unk> the government.
And because the government ultimately made us -- remember that of <unk> the <unk> the way of thinking about it is going to affect the way that change is.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought the government was to choose to choose people to get <unk>
Well, after two years, I have come to the conclusion that the government is about everything, a matter of <unk>
This is the center of <unk> phone and information.
It's the place that calls the calls if you brand <unk> in the U.S.
Scott <unk> this call.
He joined official knowledge.
I found nothing. It started with animal control.
And finally he said, "Hey, you can open the doors of the house, put music well and see if you <unk>
And it worked. So well for Scott.
But that wasn't the end of the <unk>
Boston has no center.
It has a web and mobile app called <unk> <unk>
Don't <unk> that application.
It was the work of very clever people from the Office of New York City in Boston.
One day, this happened, this <unk> <unk> in my cube <unk> I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do to <unk>
The dynamic of <unk> <unk> is different.
Scott was talking in person.
In <unk> <unk> everything is public, so everybody can see this.
In this case, he saw it a neighbor.
The next report said, "I went to the place, I found the garbage cube behind the house.
<unk> Yes. <unk> Yes.
I went home. And I went home.
Good evening, sweet nights.
Quite simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of the digital and physical <unk>
And it's also a great example of government income to criminal voluntary collaboration.
But it's also a great example of government as a platform.
And I don't necessarily mean the definition of technology of platform.
I'm talking about a platform for people to join and help others.
So, an citizen helped another but here the government had a key role.
I connected two people.
And it could have connected with the government services of being necessary, but the neighbor is a better alternative, and cheaper than government services.
When a neighbor is helping each other, <unk> the communities.
If we call control of animals, that costs a lot of money.
One important thing we have to think about the government is that it's not the same as politics.
A lot of people do it, but think that one is the entrance to the other.
That our input to the government system is a vote.
How many times have chosen a political leader, we sometimes spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader, and then we hope that the government will take our values and our values and our needs and then we don't see changes.
That's because the government is like an immense ocean and politics is the superficial <unk> <unk>
And below is what we call <unk>
And we say that word with a lot of contempt.
But it is that <unk> what keeps us that belongs to that that we funded as something that they operate in our against, that other thing, and on a consequence we're missing power.
People believe that politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work, we'll have to make the bureaucracy sexy.
Because that's where the real government work.
We have to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes the movement <unk>
They have <unk>
It's a group of citizens concerned with a very detailed report that has been written by a very detailed report in response to the order of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> on the financial reform.
That's not political activism that's not a activism of <unk>
And so that we have <unk> to the government, it's time for us to ask ourselves, what world is we want to leave our children.
You have to see the huge challenges that they will have to face.
They really believe that we will get to where we have to go without solving the institution that can act on behalf of <unk>
We can't get away from government, we need it to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology it's possible to rethink the root function so that it can expand <unk> to civil society.
There's a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows that it's not that hard to act <unk> you just have to articulate the systems in the right way.
The average age of our members is from 28 years old, so I was a generation of a generation that many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up taking the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about who is going to be <unk> they're all going to speak.
They can express your opinions on any channel at the same time and they do.
So when you face the government problem they don't really care about making their voices.
They're using hands.
They bring the work to program applications to make applications better to the government.
And those applications allow us to use our hands to improve our communities.
It can be <unk> a <unk> taking off <unk> <unk> dumping a trash cube that has a <unk> inside.
Of course, we were able to be cleaned those <unk> and a lot of people do it.
But these applications are like digital <unk> that we're not only consumers, we're not only consumers of government we pay taxes and get services.
We are more than that; we're citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until they don't get the <unk>
So I want to ask everyone here, when it comes to the important things that we have to do together, we are going to be a crowd of voices, or we're going to be a crowd of hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in prisons, prisons and <unk>
I've spent most of my life in developing communities in projects and places where there's a lot of despair.
And being here at TED watching and hearing these <unk> has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things that I've noticed in this short time is that TED has identity.
And the things you say here have impact around the world.
Sometimes if something comes from TED, you have a sense and a force that wouldn't have in a different way.
I say this because I think identity is <unk>
So here we've seen fantastic presentations.
And I think we've learned that the words of a teacher can make a lot of sense, but if they are taught with feeling, they can have a special meaning.
A doctor can do good things, <unk> if it's <unk> it can get much more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I didn't really learn this in the practice of the law, my work.
I learned it from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional family home in a <unk> family, because I was my grandmother.
It was tough it was strong, he had power.
It was the last word in the whole family.
She <unk> a lot of <unk> in our home.
She was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
Her parents were born in slavery in Virginia <unk>
She was born about the <unk> and her experience with slavery to <unk> the way the world looked like.
She was hard, but it was also <unk>
When I was a little girl, and I looked at her, she was approaching me and I gave me a good hug.
I was so strong that I could barely breathe and then <unk>
One or two hours later, I would come back to <unk> I was approaching him, and I said, <unk> still feel like my <unk>
And if I told him that no, I love him again and if I said yes, leaving me in peace.
I had this human quality that would always wish to be close to it.
The only problem is that I had 10 children.
My mother was the lowest of 10.
Sometimes when I was going to spend a time with her, it wasn't easy to get his time and her attention.
My cousins were running everywhere.
I remember when I was eight or nine years old, I woke up one morning, and I went to the room, and I was running all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me <unk>
At first, I thought it was a game.
And so I looked at it and I was <unk> but she was very serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she stood up, I walked across the room, and she took me out of my hand and said, "Come on <unk> The two will <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I'll never forget it.
It took me outside and said, <unk> I'll tell you something, but you can't tell <unk>
I said, "Okay, <unk>
She said, "Now <unk> I didn't do -- I said, "Sure."
Then I sat down, he looked at me and said, "I want you to know that I've been <unk>
And <unk> <unk> who are <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you <unk>
I'll never forget it.
And then he said, "Just want me to give me three things, you know.
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "The first thing I want you to ask me, is that you always want your mother."
<unk> "She is my <unk> and you have to <unk> that always <unk>
As I <unk> my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
Then he said to me, the second thing I want you to do is you will always do the right thing even though the right thing is <unk>
I thought of him, and I said, "Yes, <unk> So <unk>
And then finally he said, "The third thing I want you to ask me, is that you never <unk> <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
I grew up in the field in South rural. I have a brother a older year and a sister a younger year.
When I was 14 -- 15, one day my brother came home with a <unk> package I don't know where the <unk> caught my sister and I went to the forest.
We just come out by doing the <unk> of <unk>
He took a sip of beer, he offered my sister, she took a little bit and volunteered to me.
I said, "No, no, no. That's okay. You <unk> but I'm not going to take <unk>
My brother said, <unk> <unk> <unk> and you always do the same thing as we do.
I already took something, your sister as well.
I said, "No. I wouldn't feel good, you can <unk>
Then my brother looked at me.
And he said, "What's going on? Take a <unk>
And I was looking at the strength and said, "Oh, not that you're still thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that probably shouldn't say.
I know this is spreading <unk>
But I have 52 years and I can admit that I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I'm not saying this is a <unk> I mean by the power that the identity.
When we create the right type of identity, we say things to others that they really don't make any sense.
We can't get them to do things that don't think they can do.
I think my grandmother naturally believed that all his grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been a prisoner for <unk>
My parents died of age-related disease?
And these were the things that we had to do with it <unk>
Now, try to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is now very different than it was 40 years ago.
In <unk> there were 300,000 prisoners.
Today there is 2.3 million now.
In America, we have the largest incarceration rate in <unk>
We have seven million people in liberty.
And this massive incarceration, in my view, has fundamentally changed our world.
In the poor and poor communities there are so much <unk> so much despair.
One of three black men between 18 and 30 years is in jail or <unk>
In urban <unk> across the country, Los <unk> Philadelphia, Baltimore Washington, from 50 to 60 percent of all young people are in jail or freedom in jail or freedom.
Our system is not just distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country, we have a court system that is a lot better if you're rich and guilty that if you're poor and innocent.
It's not <unk> but wealth is <unk>
And it seems to be very <unk>
The politics of fear and anger make us believe that these are not a problem of ours.
We're <unk>
I find it interesting.
We're looking at our work some pretty curious.
In my state, in Alabama, well as in other states, you have <unk> for always if you have a criminal <unk>
Right now in Alabama, <unk> of <unk> male male has definitely lost the right to vote.
And if we put it over the next 10 years, the level of loss of rights will be as high as it was before they <unk> the law of the right to vote.
We have this awesome silence.
I represent children.
Many of my customers are very young.
America is the only country in the world where they were sentence to <unk> to die in prison.
We have in this prison country for children, no possibility of getting done.
Now we're in the process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
<unk> people on death row people.
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
In some sense we have been <unk> to think that the final question is, people deserve to die by the <unk> <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think of another way about how we're in our identity.
There's another way of <unk> it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die for <unk> <unk> but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
death penalty is defined by error.
In every nine <unk> people have identified one which is innocent that it's <unk> and liberated from death row.
An innocent mistake, <unk> an innocent in every nine.
This is interesting.
In aviation it would not be allowed to be able to never fly airplanes if in every nine to <unk> you would have been <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our struggle.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue of whether we deserve to kill.
It's interesting that in my classes with students on <unk> history, I talk about slavery on the <unk>
I talk to you about terrorism, the time that started at the end of the reconstruction and that lasted to the Second World War.
Really, we don't know a lot about this.
But for black Americans in this country, it was very defined by terror.
In many communities people were afraid to be <unk>
They were worried about being <unk>
The terror threat was what defined his lives.
Now there are older people who come up to me and say, <unk> Stevenson, you teach talks, <unk> <unk> to the people who stop saying that in our history we deal with about terrorism, after the <unk>
They ask me to say, "No. Say that we grew up with that."
The age of terrorism went from obviously, with segregation and decades of <unk> and <unk>
In this country we have a dynamic that we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood what we've historically done before.
All of the time we had a few others.
We create tensions and conflict.
It costs us to talk about races. I think it's because we're not willing to engage with a real truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that they could not be able to overcome racial <unk> without a commitment to the truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany giving talks about death.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood up after my presentation and said, "You know that it's good disturbing to listen to what you <unk>
<unk> "We don't have death row in Germany.
<unk> we'll never be able to have it here."
The room sat in silence and a lady said, "There's no way with our history, we can never get into the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational that we <unk> <unk> and <unk> to run the people."
<unk> about this.
How would we feel in a world where a nation like Germany, <unk> people, especially if they were mostly <unk>
We could not be <unk>
Would that be irrational.
And yet, there is this disconnection.
I think our identity is in danger.
If we really don't care about these issues, the positive things and wonderful things they are, though, <unk>
We love innovation.
We are fascinated by technology.
We love entertainment.
But lately, those realities are <unk> by suffering, by abuse, <unk> <unk>
In my view, you need to integrate two things.
We've talked about the need to have more hope, more commitment, more dedication with the basic challenges of this complex world.
I think that means to spend more time thinking and talking about the poor, the <unk> that never come to TED.
And thinking about them is, in a way, something that's inside of us.
It's true that we have to believe in issues that we haven't seen.
So we are. In spite of being so rational, so committed to intellectual <unk>
<unk> with innovation, development is not just of brain thinking.
These things come from <unk> ideas also by the <unk> of the heart.
This connection of mind with heart is what drives us to look at not just the bright and <unk> but also in the dark and the hard.
<unk> <unk> the great leader <unk> talking about this.
He said, "When we were in East Europe, suffering the <unk> we wanted all sorts of things, but mainly what we needed was hope, to spirit, a will for the spirit, a will for being in places of despair and being <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is pretty much at the heart of what I think, that even in communities like TED, must be <unk>
There's no disconnect related to technology and design, which allows us to truly be humans if we don't pay care if we don't pay attention to poverty, attention to poverty, to injustice.
Now I want to tell you that these thoughts make a much more challenging identity than if we ignored these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege of being a very young lawyer -- to meet Rosa <unk>
These women were just gathered to speak.
Occasionally, the lady <unk> I was called to go, <unk> comes the lady <unk> We're going to get together to speak.
Do you want to come and <unk>
I would say, "Be lady. I do."
So she said, "Well what are you going to do when you <unk>
I read him <unk>
So I was going to go and just <unk>
It was very <unk> very <unk>
And on one occasion, I was there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple hours, Mrs. Parks went to me and said to me, "Now, <unk> me that this idea of justice <unk>
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I started giving my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been convicted of <unk>
We try to confront prejudice and discrimination in criminal justice administration.
We try to end up with the sentences of life, without freedom <unk> for children.
We try to do something about death row.
We try to reduce the population in prisons.
We try to end the <unk> <unk>
I gave all my best speech and at the end of me he looked at me and said, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> <unk> very <unk>
At that time, Mrs. <unk> <unk> my finger in the face and said, "That's why you have to be very much, but very <unk>
I think in fact, the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We need to find the way to deal with those challenges, those problems, that suffering.
Because finally, humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been educated in simple things.
I have come to understand and believe that every one of us is higher to the worst thing that we have.
I think that's true for everyone on the planet.
I'm convinced that if somebody says a lie, it's not because it's a liar.
I'm sure if someone takes something that doesn't belong to you, it's not a <unk>
Even if someone kills each other, it's not a <unk>
So I think there's a basic dignity in the people who should be <unk> by law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not the wealth.
That's not it.
I really think that in many parts the opposite of poverty is justice.
And finally, I think even though it's very <unk> very beautiful, very <unk> very <unk> we don't judge our technology by our designs, not by our intellectual and intellectual capacity.
In the end, it <unk> the character of a society, not as they treat rich and powerful and <unk> but in the way they treat the poor, the <unk> the prisoners.
Because it's in this context as we started to understand truly profound issues about what we are.
I feel <unk> I'm going to end up with a story.
Sometimes I do too much force.
<unk> tired, <unk>
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my <unk> in a major way.
I've been representing these guys who have been <unk> with a lot of <unk>
I'm going to jail and I see my clients 13 and 14 years old, who have been <unk> so they were <unk> as adults as adults.
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge turn to somebody who isn't it?
The judge would take it as an adult, but I see a child.
One very late night I was awake at <unk> for God, if the judge can turn you into something you don't are, you must have magical powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has <unk> powers.
You should ask for some of that.
As it was, I couldn't think correctly, but I started working on a <unk>
I had a <unk> <unk> a tiny, black <unk>
I started working on the <unk> with a <unk> who said, <unk> so that my black client was treated as a <unk> white <unk> of a <unk>
In <unk> I put there there have been <unk> behavior in <unk> in the behavior of the police and in the process.
There was a <unk> line on how this country is no ethics, but a lack of ethics.
The next morning, I woke up thinking that <unk> <unk> would be a dream, or really <unk>
For my horror, not just the <unk> I had been sent to court.
It was about two months, I had forgotten it.
And finally, <unk> Oh God, I have to go to the cut for this case, stupid.
I got into the car, and I felt truly <unk> <unk>
I was in the car to court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
I finally went down the car. He walked on to court.
I was going up the stairs when I found a black man <unk> was the <unk> of the courthouse.
When he saw me, he came up to me and said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> He said, "It's <unk> I said yes.
So I approached it and <unk>
And I was <unk> in the ear, right?
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
That connected deeply to my interior, with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I walked into the <unk>
When they arrived, the judge saw me.
And he said, <unk> Stevenson, you wrote this bold <unk>
I said, "I know Mr. "I did."
People started to go. They were all <unk>
I was the one that had written those <unk>
They came the policemen the <unk> the <unk> the <unk>
Suddenly, we didn't know how, the room was full of people. Everything was married because we talked about races, because we were talking about poverty, because we talked about inequality.
With the eye of the eye, I ended up seeing the <unk> that was going and <unk>
I would look down the window and <unk> to hear all that <unk>
<unk> walking over here and there.
Finally, this old black, with a face of concern, I entered the room and sat behind me, almost on the table of lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, the judge <unk> a <unk>
During the break, a <unk> showed <unk> because the <unk> had entered the room.
The <unk> ran over the old black <unk>
And he said, <unk> what do you do in the <unk> room.
And the old black man stood up and looked at the <unk> and he looked at me and said, <unk> this room of audiences to tell this young woman to keep her view in the objective of <unk>
I have come to TED today, because I think many of you understand that the moral bow of the universe is very big, but it folds up to justice.
That we can't truly be human beings -- if we don't worry about human rights and for dignity.
That our survival is connected to each other.
That our visions of technology, design, entertainment and creativity must <unk> to the <unk> <unk> and justice.
And above all, those of the people here who share this, I just want to tell you that keep the view on the goal with <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: <unk> to hear and see an obvious desire for the audience, of this community, to help in your <unk> to do something.
Something that is not a check. What can we do?
<unk> There are several opportunities close to us.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a <unk> this spring in which you will have an effort to <unk> the funds that you spend today in terms of punishment.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars in death row over the next five years, a billion dollars.
And despite this, the <unk> of the homicide cases not <unk> in <unk>
The <unk> of rapes do not come to anything.
Here's a chance of change.
This <unk> is going to come up with these funds to make the law of the law and the security.
I think there's a very close opportunity.
CA: There's been a huge decline in the <unk> in the United States in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation, is that it has to do with the biggest rate of <unk>
What would you say to the people you think is this?
<unk> Actually, the rate of <unk> with violence has remained relatively stable.
The big growth in mass <unk> in this country is not for crimes with violence.
It's the wrong war against drugs.
That's why this dramatic increase in the <unk> population.
And we had to convince us for the rhetoric of punishment.
We have three legal causes.
I think we need to do more to help the victims of the <unk> and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy about punishment does nothing for anyone.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> you've been excited about this today.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for having to come to TED. Thank you.
Announcer: <unk> the threats from Bin Laden.
<unk> 2: <unk> in Somalia. <unk> 3: <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> 4: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> six: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Several <unk> War and <unk> mass destruction.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
Oh, my God!
Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips that I got in the last six months, <unk> could be the last six days or the last six years.
The idea is that media media would prefer <unk> negative news, because our minds pay attention to you.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of every day, our senses get a lot more data than probably the brain can <unk>
And as nothing matters to survive, the first stop of all of this data is an old piece of the temporal lobe called <unk>
The amygdala is our early detection, the early <unk>
<unk> and recorded all the information for something in the environment that could make us harm.
So by a <unk> of stories <unk> to look at the negative.
That old saying of <unk> "If there is blood, <unk> is very true.
And because all of the digital devices are giving us negative news, the seven days of week, 24 hours a day, no wonder that we are <unk>
It's not surprising that people think the world is going to be wrong with worse.
But maybe not that way.
Maybe, in change, what really happens is that we get <unk>
Maybe the enormous progress has done in the last century by a series of forces is <unk> so that we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems -- climate change, the <unk> of <unk> water scarcity and <unk> we have no doubt we have.
As human beings, we are very good at <unk> the problems and the long run, we just ended up with them.
<unk> then what happened in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average of life has been more than <unk> the average income per capita approach has <unk> around the world.
Child mortality has reduced 10 times.
Also, the cost of food food and communication and communications, has fallen from 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we are living the most peaceful time of human history.
And Charles <unk> that the global literacy country spent 25 percent more than 80 percent in the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people do it.
And we continue to have higher expectations.
In fact, <unk> the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in America, most of the people who live under the poverty line have electricity, water, toilets, <unk> television, air conditioning and cars.
The <unk> <unk> from the last century, the <unk> of the planet, would never have dreamed of such <unk>
We have a lot of this technology and lately, its exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that <unk> in the technology of information jumps on this curve, Moore's Law, and doubling the performance of the price at about 12 to 24 months.
So the mobile phone that you have in your pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer from the '70s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to watch two things at this curve.
First of all, the soft thing that is -- in good and bad times, in war and peace, in recession in <unk> to <unk>
It's the test of computers that are used to build faster.
It doesn't stop before any of the big challenges.
And even though it's <unk> in a law on the left, it goes up up.
The growth rate of technology is itself faster and faster.
And on this curve, to <unk> of Moore's Law, there's a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we have today.
The cloud in the cloud, that my friends are called infinite <unk> sensors and networks, and the 3D printing and the ability to democratize the personalized production and the <unk> biology, the synthetic biology, the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> and the <unk>
I mean, how many of you saw the victory on "Jeopardy" <unk>
It was <unk>
I looked at the <unk> the best headline I <unk>
And I loved this: <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk>
"Jeopardy" is not an easy game.
It plays the <unk> of human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available for everyone on your phone.
Four years ago, Ray Kurzweil and I launched a new university called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can they be used to solve the big challenges of humanity.
And each year we asked them to release a company, or a product or the service that may positively affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students today can impact a billion people.
Thirty years ago, it would have been <unk> absurd.
Today we can point out a <unk> of companies that have already done before.
When I think about creating abundance, it doesn't mean to create <unk> life for every single <unk> on this planet, it's about creating a life of possible.
It's about taking that that's <unk> and making it <unk>
You see, scarcity is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
I'll give you an example.
It's a story of Napoleon <unk> in the <unk>
He is the guy on the left.
<unk> the dinner <unk>
The troops from Napoleon ate with <unk> and the same <unk> with covered with gold.
But the king of <unk> ate with <unk> of aluminum.
You see, the aluminum was the most precious metal on Earth; was worth more than gold and <unk>
That's why the end of the Washington Washington <unk>
You see, even the aluminum is the <unk> of the mass of the Earth, it doesn't come like pure <unk>
It's tied by oxygen and <unk>
But then he came the <unk> and he made the aluminum something so cheap we use it as if it was <unk>
It <unk> this analogy towards the future.
Let's think about energy.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are on a planet that are <unk> for 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They come to the Earth 16 <unk> of energy every 88
It's not about <unk> but <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar power in India is 50 percent less than the generated by <unk> <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar energy dropped 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT published a study that shows that at the end of the decade, in the <unk> parts of the United States, solar electricity will cost six cents per hour compared to 15 cents in national average.
And if we have abundance of energy we also have water abundance as well.
So let's talk about the wars in the water.
You remember when Carl Sagan has pointed at the Voyager space spacecraft on Earth, in 1990, after <unk>
<unk> a famous picture -- how do they <unk>
"A <unk> <unk>
Because we live on a planet of water.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent of water.
Yes, <unk> is saltwater, two percent of it is ice, and we fought for the <unk> of the water on the planet, but there's also a hope.
It's a technology available not in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes out of nanotechnology, the <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators in the <unk> I'd like to share with you -- he gave me permission to <unk> his technology called <unk> <unk> the <unk> is the size of a small fridge small.
It's capable of generating a thousand liters of water to the day of any source, saltwater, water water, a <unk> for less than two cents a gallon.
The president of Coke just thought to make a major test for hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out well, and I have full confidence that this will be, Coca-Cola will actually implement it in <unk> in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is an inclusive innovation for this technology that exists today.
And we've seen it in mobile phones.
My God, we're going to get to 70 percent penetration of mobile phones in the developing world for the end of 2013.
<unk> that warrior <unk> has better cell phones in the middle of Kenya that President Reagan 25 years ago.
And to have a smart phone with Google, you have access to more knowledge and information that the president is 15 years ago.
She lives in a world of abundance of information and communications that no one could have predicted before.
So better than that, the things that you and I have paid tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- video <unk> video -- images, libraries of books and music, <unk> technology <unk> now <unk> and lose value market with mobile phones.
Maybe the best thing comes to when you show up the health applications.
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce the <unk> Foundation called the X <unk> <unk> <unk> 10 million dollars.
We're challenging the equipment for the world to make these technologies in a mobile device with the talk, and because it has <unk> you can get blood from your finger <unk>
To win it has to make better diagnostics than a certificate.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world in which there is no doctors, where the burden of <unk> is 25 percent of the health workers.
When this device is <unk> a RNA virus or DNA or DNA that you don't want to call in the <unk> and first of all, to stop the pandemic.
But this is the biggest force of producing a <unk> world.
I call it the billion <unk>
The white lines here are the population.
We've just got the brand of seven billion.
By the way, the best protection against population explosion is to give the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, we'll spend two billion to five billion users of the Internet.
Three billion minds never before they add up to the global conversation.
What would these people?
What <unk> What <unk>
And instead of economic collapse we will have the largest economic injection in history.
These people represent tens of trillions of dollars in the global economy.
And <unk> of more health because of a better education with the Khan Academy of Khan Academy and because of 3D <unk> and computation in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can we provide three billion members of human humanity, healthy and <unk>
How about voices never before <unk>
What if we give them the oppressed. wherever we give them a voice to be heard, and we could do for the first time?
What do these 3,000 billion?
And if they are contributions we can't <unk>
One thing that I learned with the X <unk> is that small teams guided by his passion with a single goal, you can do things that were <unk> things that were only able to do the big corporations and governments.
I'm going to end up sharing a story that really excites me.
There's a program that maybe some of you know.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how to fold the protein.
<unk> determine structure and functionality.
It's very important in medical research.
And so far, it was a problem of <unk>
They've played with this college professors, among others.
Then hundreds of thousands of people came together and started <unk>
And it's shown today that the machinery of human patterns is better and better and better proteins than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me a huge trust in the future is that we have more power as people to take major challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion of <unk> <unk>
We have the capital of the <unk>
And we have three billion minds that are <unk> to work on the solution of big challenges and do what we should do.
We have a few extraordinary decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very <unk> idea.
<unk> <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, before I give them three examples to make time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
Maybe they believed that <unk> <unk> but it wasn't like that.
It actually <unk> fish.
And he described one of them as very <unk>
It was <unk>
He caught it a lot to the <unk>
Now the fish is in the Red <unk>
But we've heard this story many times in the Galapagos and other places, so that has nothing special.
But the case is that we still come to Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
The leaflets they still say they keep <unk>
So what happens here?
The second story, also illustrates another concept: <unk>
Because I was there in <unk> studying a meal in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe, and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought it could be <unk>
I burned a lot with the sun and I convinced it that I wasn't there.
This is my first exhibition to the sun.
The diver was surrounded by <unk> and, as you can see, from some <unk>
There was <unk> from about 20 centimeter <unk> <unk>
And the fishery of this <unk> was very abundant and spent for a good moment, so he made more than half in Ghana.
When I was there 27 years later the amount of fish had dropped in half.
I <unk> to the <unk>
It was a genetic pressure.
There was still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing has changed, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was <unk> in the introduction of <unk> in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s <unk> in the <unk> Europe did a lot of development projects.
The fishing development was to impose to the countries that already had 100,000 <unk> <unk> industrial fishing.
And this very cool boat, I called the <unk> four.
I went out fishing in it, and we did studies in the southern Sea of China <unk> and, above all, in the Beaufort Sea.
What we used to capture was something <unk>
<unk> I know what the sea sea is.
Ninety percent of what we capture were <unk> other animals that are on the bottom.
And most of the fish are <unk> tiny about a few <unk> remains that are coral coral fish.
In short, the sea bottom came to the cover and then it was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast.
In a year, you do a study, and then you start the commercial fishing.
The bottom line is a solid coral fund that is soft in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a <unk> <unk>
Don't <unk> The <unk> because they were dead.
We once captured a alive.
I was still not <unk>
So they wanted to <unk> because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains is what the fishermen are getting every time they go to an area where they have never fish.
But there was no <unk>
We <unk> the world, but we don't remember it.
<unk> the starting point of starting -- a new level, without remembering what was there.
If you look at this something like this.
On the axis, we have <unk> <unk> number of killer <unk> the <unk> of the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time. It changes because people do things with <unk>
Each generation will use images at the beginning of their conscious life as normal and extrapolate forward.
The difference is they perceive loss.
But they don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can analyze the string of changes.
And at the end to keep some <unk> remains.
And that is largely we want to do it now.
We want to keep things that they don't are, or not what they are.
But you should think that this problem affects people when societies <unk> kill animals without knowing what they've done to some generations later.
Because obviously, an animal that's very plentiful, before <unk> is <unk>
You don't lose animal animals.
You lose animals.
Even if this isn't perceived as a big loss.
Over time, we focus on large animals, and in a sea that's synonymous with large fish.
They become <unk> because the <unk>
We have a few fish, but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know that it was different.
In fact, a lot of people, scientists, <unk> that was very different.
And they will do it because the evidence presented in an earlier way, is not the way they expect them to have evidence.
So for example, the anecdote that some of the <unk> as a man as captain and so looked at a lot of fish in this area can't be used, or generally not use the scientists of the fishery, because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we live in <unk> societies because they don't rely on the sources of the past.
There is a huge role that can play a protected marine area.
Because with the marine zones, we really recreated the past.
<unk> the past that people can't conceive because the starting point has been <unk> and it's extremely low.
That's for people who can see a protected marine area and can benefit from the vision that <unk> which allows them to erase their <unk>
And what about people who can't do it because they have no access, like people in the West in the West for example?
I think that the arts and cinema may maybe fill in the vacuum. The simulation.
This is a simulation of <unk> Bay.
So long ago there were gray whales gray whales in <unk> Bay.
And you may have noticed that the <unk> and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think about why people were touched by the movie <unk> to talk about the story of <unk> why they <unk> with <unk>
Because it raises something that in a certain sense, has been lost.
So my <unk> the only one to give, is Cameron, making <unk> <unk> under the water.
Thank you very much.
Hi. I'm Kevin <unk> the <unk> <unk> manager -- and I look at YouTube videos in a professional form.
It's true.
So today, we're going to see why the videos are <unk> and how important it is.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> When I was younger, that seemed very, very hard.
But today the web video makes any of us, or of our actions, copper phones in a part of our global culture.
Anybody can be famous on the Internet in a <unk>
They go up over 48 hours of video to YouTube for a minute.
And of those, only a little percentage of the little percentage goes viral gets lots of views and makes it <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: creators of trends, and a surprise.
Okay, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh my God, my God.
Oh my God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this shot shot outside his house in <unk> National Park.
In 2010, it was seen 23 million times.
This chart shows the views in popular summer.
<unk> didn't say a viral video.
I just wanted to share a double rainbow.
That's what you do if it's called <unk> Mountain <unk>
I had already published many videos of nature.
This video had been published in January.
So what happened here?
It was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> published this tweet that <unk> the video to <unk>
The creators of trends like Jimmy <unk> presented with new and interesting things and <unk> to a wider public.
Rebecca <unk>  It's Friday, Friday. You have to start on a Friday.   Everybody wants to come in a week, the weekend.   <unk> Friday. <unk> a Friday.  KA: Don't think we could have this conversation without talking about this video, I hope.
<unk> is one of the most popular videos of the year.
They saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This chart shows how often we use.
Just like <unk> <unk> this video seemed to have come out of nowhere.
So what happened this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask for those other <unk> they're also Friday.
But what happened this day, this particular Friday <unk>
Well, he took it <unk> and many blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. <unk> from <unk> Science <unk> was one of the first people to make a joke about video on Twitter.
But the important thing is that one person or the creators of trends embrace a view of view, and they share it with a wider audience, accelerating the process.
So, this community of people who shares this big inner joke then starts talking about that and do things.
And now there are 10,000 <unk> <unk> on YouTube.
In the first seven days, there was a parody for each of the other days.
Unlike the entertainment entertainment entertainment of the 20th century, this community participation is our way to be part of the <unk> phenomenon, or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is an animation <unk> with a <unk> music.
That's it. That's it.
This year you saw it about 50 million times.
And if you think that's rare, you know there's a version of three hours that you've seen four million times.
Even the cats saw this video.
And there are cats that saw other cats to see the video.
But the important thing here is the creativity that I woke up in the <unk> community of the Internet.
There was <unk>
Somebody made a version of the old one.
And then it became international <unk>
All of a sudden, a whole community of <unk> that made it happen to be a joke that would happen to something that we all can form part.
Because today not just <unk> <unk>
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who could have predicted <unk> <unk> or Rebecca <unk> or <unk> <unk>
What script might have been written to be <unk> this situation?
In a world where two days of video are going up a minute, only that really only and unexpected can be <unk> so that these things have been done.
When a friend told me that I had to see this great video of a guy who <unk> <unk> in New York, I admit that I didn't get interested in it.
Casey <unk> I am <unk> by the <unk> but there are often obstacles that keep you properly <unk>
KA: Thanks to the surprise and his humor, Casey <unk> made that five million people saw and understand their idea.
So this approach is worth all new things we do in a creative way.
And all of this leads us to a big question.
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
<unk> -- creative communities, creative communities, so unexpected, are characteristics of a new kind of media, in a new culture, that we all have access and is the audience that defines the popularity of it.
As I said before, one of the celebrity <unk> <unk> Justin started on YouTube.
They don't <unk> permission to express your ideas.
Now we're all a little owner of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media features -- they're just the current media -- but it <unk> the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that's still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a lifetime.
It's a poet, a man whose entire life had been supported by the unique life of unit and freedom of his country.
<unk> as the <unk> come into <unk> <unk> the fact that his life had been totally <unk>
So the words, for so long, my friends now <unk>
It's <unk> in silence.
He died of the story.
He's my grandfather.
I never met him.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget his story.
My task was not to let that have been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story tried to <unk> but <unk>
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat boat -- <unk> <unk> into the sea.
My mother, <unk> was only 18 years old when his father died, and a <unk> marriage and two small girls.
For her, life had gone to a task -- the escape from his family and a new life in Australia.
It was <unk> for her that I couldn't do it.
And after a <unk> <unk> that challenges the fiction, a boat slid into the heart of <unk> <unk>
All adults knew the risks.
The greatest fear was the <unk> rape and death.
Like most adults -- my mother carried a <unk> with poison.
If we were <unk> we would first take my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the constant rate of the motor, <unk> diving into each wave, and the vast <unk> vast and empty horizon.
I don't remember <unk> that came several times, but they were <unk> with the courage of men on our boat, or the engine dying and not being able to start for six hours.
But I do remember the lights on the oil platform in front of the coast of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and died, I finish the journey was too much to get it, and the first apple I did, given by the men on the platform.
No apple had then the same flavor.
After three months in a refugee camp, <unk> <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women along three generations to make a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a suburb of <unk> class, whose population is <unk>
Unlike the <unk> <unk> whose existence I <unk> in <unk> there was no sense of the right.
The smells that came from the stores were the rest of the world.
And the fragments of English <unk> <unk> among people who had one thing in common: they were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, then on a car assembly line, working six days <unk>
Yet, I found time to study English and get a degree on I.T. <unk>
We were poor.
All of the dollars were <unk> and established an extra <unk> in English and mathematics, wouldn't mind what should be <unk> that was usually <unk> clothes was always <unk>
Two <unk> pairs for school, one to hide the holes from the other.
A school uniform to <unk> because I had to last six years.
And there were rare <unk> and <unk> on the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> back home."
At home, where?
Something in me <unk>
He was accumulating determination and a voice that said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I <unk> in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we were <unk> on our day and <unk> the movements of our grandmother at the house.
My mother had <unk> all of the boat.
And my task was to be awake until his nightmares were to be able to <unk>
She opened a computer store, and then I studied to be <unk> and he opened another business.
And the women would come with their stories about men who couldn't make the transition and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> boys caught between two worlds.
They looked for subsidies and <unk>
And they created centers.
I lived in <unk> worlds.
In one, it was the classic classical <unk> <unk> with whatever <unk> of myself.
On the other another, I was <unk> in <unk> lives, tragically <unk> by violence, drug abuse and <unk>
But many received help through the years.
And for that work, when I was studying my last year of lawyer when I was elected by the young Australian young of the year.
And I was <unk> from one piece of the puzzle to the other, but the edges are not <unk>
So <unk> <unk> resident was now so <unk> refugee and social activist invited to speak at the sites that I never had heard of, and in homes whose existence she had never imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retreat into the <unk> and the comfort of life in a suburb -- a grandmother, a mother, a mother and two daughters ending the day as they did for almost 20 years, <unk> on the day of each one and <unk> <unk> the three still in the same bed.
And I told my mom who couldn't do it.
It reminded me that I was now the same age that she had when we get into the boat.
<unk> had never been an option.
<unk> told me, "What are you not going to be <unk>
So I talked about juvenile <unk> and education and <unk> to marginalized and <unk>
And the more frankly I talked about, the more it was <unk> to speak.
I met people from all the roads in life, many of them doing what we were living in, living on the frontier.
And although I ended up my <unk> I realized I couldn't stay in a career of <unk>
There was another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's okay to be a stranger, a newly new line in the scene -- and not only is it right, but it's something that being grateful, maybe a gift of the ship.
Because being inside it can easily mean <unk> <unk> can easily mean to accept the assumptions of your <unk>
I gave enough steps outside of my comfort zone to know that, yes, the world will be <unk> but not the way we fear it.
<unk> they wouldn't have been <unk> they were <unk>
There was a energy there, <unk> <unk> a rare mixture of humility and <unk>
So I kept on intuition.
He brought a small group of people for the people who <unk> can't <unk> it was a <unk> challenge.
For a year we didn't have a <unk>
At the end of every day, I would make a giant sign of soup that all <unk>
They were going to stay well at night.
Most of our ideas were mad, but some brilliant, and we open up.
I made the decision to move to the U.S.
After a single journey.
My <unk> again.
Three months later, I had <unk> and <unk> adventure.
Before the end, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time when <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who cared for.
Life had not changed for centuries.
Her father died shortly after she was born.
The mother grew up alone.
At 17 it became a <unk> of a <unk> whose mother <unk>
Without support of his husband, he made a <unk> to the <unk> and to take the cause of it, and much more <unk> caused when I won.
He can't have proved to be wrong.
I was in the shower in a hotel room in <unk> when she was killed 1,000 miles, in <unk>
I looked through the <unk> of the shower and saw her stop on the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple.
We tell the stories and we made sure we were still with it.
At night a monk came up and told us that I had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to raise her hand.
I asked the <unk> "Why his hand is hot, and the rest of the body so <unk>
Because you've taken your hand from the <unk> he said.
"You don't have <unk>
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Since we were and how life built us, we can now see that the men that had come to our lives would have been <unk>
The defeat would be easily <unk>
Now I want to have my own kids, and I wonder about the boat.
Who might want that to do for it?
However, I fear the privilege of easy to the right.
I can give you a <unk> in your lives, a brave in each wave, the <unk> rate of the motor, the vast horizon that you won't guarantee nothing?
I don't know.
But if I could take it to you and see them safe I would do it.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of <unk> is here in the fourth or fifth row.
My story begins in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the <unk> sky with the singer <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were having a conversation about how nothing has changed since the time of the former Indian <unk> "The <unk>
In those days when the Indians want to travel to a car and <unk> the sky.
Now we do it with airplanes.
In that time when I was <unk> the great Prince <unk> Indian, he was <unk> he pulled a bow and with a <unk> on the ground, he could get water.
Now we do the same with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion that we took was that the machinery had replaced the magic.
And that was very excited about it.
Every time I felt a little bit more <unk>
I took this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciating a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't get my friends.
It seemed like the technology had to allow magic, not to <unk>
As a girl my grandfather gave me her <unk> <unk>
And this piece of technology for 50 years was for my most magical thing.
It became a golden door to a world filled with images, of <unk> and <unk> in my imagination.
I had the feeling that the mobile and the luxury clocks and the cameras prevent it out.
<unk> our inspiration.
So I was <unk> I came up to this technological world to see how we use it to make magic, rather than <unk>
<unk> books from age 16 years.
So when I saw the iPad and I saw a narrative device that we can connect to the readers of the whole world.
You can know how to take the book.
Where we are.
We put the text with the image, the animation, the sound and touch.
<unk> becomes more and more <unk>
But how do we do that?
I'm about to launch <unk> an interactive application for the iPad.
He says, <unk> your fingers on each light."
And so this --  -- "This box belongs to <unk> I write my name.
And so I come back with a character of the book.
In several times I get a <unk> -- the iPad knows where I live through GPS -- that comes to me.
My inner girl gets excited with all these possibilities.
I've talked a lot about magic.
And I don't mean <unk> and <unk> but to that magic of childhood, to those ideas that we have from children.
For some reason, fireflies in a jar always became exciting to me.
So over here, we need to shift the iPad to release fireflies.
And really, they light up your way in the East of the book.
Another idea that was fascinated by a little girl was a whole galaxy in a <unk>
So here, every book and every world becomes a <unk> that I drag into this magical device inside of the device.
And this opens a map.
In every idea of fantasy there has always been maps but have been static maps.
This is a map that goes up, <unk> and guide you for the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book also <unk>
Now I'm going to come in.
Another very important aspect for me is to create Indian content, and then in contemporary times.
These are the <unk>
We've all heard of <unk> and <unk> but how many people out of India know their <unk> <unk> <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in the cameras of Indra for millennia, in an old and <unk> book.
So we're bringing them back into a <unk> child history.
In a story that deals with current issues like the environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems in the last 10 years has been that children have been <unk> attached to their <unk> they have not left the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can take our kids into the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions of the book is this adventure where you have to go outside the outside, take the camera or iPad, and gather images from different natural objects.
As a child, I had a lot of <unk> of <unk> stones, <unk> and <unk>
For some reason children don't do it.
So to get this back to this childhood ritual we have to go out and, in a chapter, I <unk> a picture to a flower and then <unk>
In other chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then <unk>
So you create a collection of pictures that you can then put on the Web.
A kid in London puts a picture of a <unk> and he says, "Oh, I saw a <unk>
A child in India says, "I saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital pictures that have gone to.
Within the variants of connection between magic, Earth and technology are there many possibilities.
In the next book, we had an interaction where you get out with the iPad and the video on and through an augmented reality you see a group of cartoons that appear on the inner plants of the house.
At a moment the screen is filled with leaves there.
And you have to do the sound of the wind and <unk> so you can read the rest of the book.
We're going to be a world in which the forces of nature will engage with technology and magic and technology to each other.
We do the energy of the sun.
We are approaching our children and ourselves to the natural world and that magic, joy and child love that we sat through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why a lot of <unk> projects.
And I think, really, that the most important thing about that is that we stop listening to patients.
And one of the things we did at the University of <unk> was <unk> to a director of listening.
And not in a very scientific way, she raised a little cup of coffee or tea and asked patients, family and <unk> What do you do?"
"How can we <unk>
And we tend to think, that this is one of the biggest problems for what everyone or maybe not all, but most of the projects of <unk> they fail, because we stop listening.
This is my graphic scale. It's a very simple thing.
It has a doorknob and it has closed down.
Every morning I was <unk>
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I had the challenge of getting to 95 percent.
But it's so simple, that every time I <unk> my information to Google <unk>
And my doctor from <unk> has access to him too. So he can see what my weight problem is, not at the same time when I need it to <unk> or some urgency of that style is to look back.
But there's another thing.
As some of you know, I have over four Twitter followers on Twitter.
So every morning I connect to my Wi-Fi scale and before you go up to my car, people start to <unk> <unk> I think you need a light.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it is pressure pressure used to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for patients stop smoking.
On the other hand, it can be <unk> to move people from their chairs and together to develop some <unk> activity to have more control of their health.
From next week, it's going to be available.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people were <unk> from their homes, to take their blood pressure, <unk> to their doctor, and share it with others, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position, return to the control of the control and being captains of its own <unk> but it also can help us health care because of the challenges that we face, as the firing of costs of attention, <unk> demand and other issues.
<unk> techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients involved in the team.
And they can do it with techniques like this, but also through <unk>
And one of the things we did like to share with you with a video with you.
We all have <unk> <unk>
Maybe we have them on our phones.
We know perfectly where <unk> <unk>
And where are all the <unk>
And of course, we can find out of fast food.
But where is the <unk> closest to help this patient?
We asked but nobody <unk>
Nobody knew where to get the <unk> saves lives right now.
What we did was <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the public <unk> you see a <unk> please <unk> <unk> where, and when it's open, because sometimes you open up in <unk> and others are closed.
And over 10,000 <unk> they were introduced in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the application for that.
And we made an app for the iPad.
We created an app for <unk> reality to find these <unk>
And every time you're in the city of <unk> and somebody <unk> can use your iPhone, and within the next weeks to use their cellular phone <unk> to find the nearest <unk> which can save lives.
And from today, I'd like to present this one, not just as <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also as a <unk>
And we want to <unk> globally.
We are <unk> all of the colleagues in the world, in other universities, to help us find and act like a center for the <unk> of <unk> around the world.
Every time you're on vacation and somebody <unk> can be a relative or someone in front of you, you can find it.
And I also want to invite companies all around the world that could help us <unk> these <unk>
You could be <unk> or <unk> people, for example, to see if the <unk> that shows is still in their place.
Please go through this and not only improve health, but take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share <unk> photograph.
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because of course, they're photographs that can't take with their cameras.
My interest in photography was aroused by my first digital camera at 15 years.
It mixed with my previous passion for the drawing, but it was a little bit different because by using the camera the process was in planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera and the process ends up when the <unk>
For me, photography had more to do with being on the right place at the right time.
It seemed like anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that I would start by pressing the <unk>
<unk> like this is a <unk> <unk>
But it has an unexpected turn.
And even though it keeps a level of <unk>
Or pictures like <unk> dark and colorful at the time, but with the common goal of keeping the <unk>
And when I say <unk> I say <unk>
Because of course, it's not something I can <unk> but I always want it to be captured in some way like photograph.
<unk> that you will have to think of a moment to discover the trick.
It's more to do with capturing an idea that with capturing a moment.
But what is the trick that makes it seem real.
It's the details or the <unk>
Do we have light?
What is the <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is a perspective.
But in the end, it's about our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive on a <unk> surface.
It's actually not about whether it's realistic but what we think is a <unk>
So I think the foundations are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality in which we took different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality.
Let me show you a simple example.
Here we have three perfectly <unk> objects that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in a certain way you can create something that still looks like <unk> as if there was there.
But at the same time, we know that it doesn't exist.
So you go to the brain because the brain doesn't embrace the fact that it doesn't really make sense.
And I see the same process that we combine the photographs.
It's really about combining different realities.
And the things that make a picture look like realistic I think they're those where we don't even <unk> the things around us in our daily lives.
But by combining photographs that is very important to <unk> because otherwise something will look wrong.
So I'd like to say that there are three simple rules that will continue to achieve realistic results.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of pictures must have the same perspective.
Secondly, photos of <unk> must have the same kind of light.
And these two images with these <unk> were taken by the same height and with the same kind of light.
The third point is to make impossible to distinguish the beginning and the end of the different images with a perfect <unk>
It has to be impossible to see where the image.
Here's another example.
You might think that this is a picture of a landscape and the bottom is <unk>
But this picture is totally composed of photographs of different places.
In the staff I think it's easier to create a place to find a place to find it because you don't need to put the ideas in the head.
But it takes a lot of planning.
And as I thought about this idea in winter I knew I had several months to try to find the different locations for the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured on a fishing trip.
The coast of a different location.
The <unk> part was captured in a <unk> well.
And yes, I even made red from the top of the island to look more <unk>
So in order to get a realistic outcome, I think it takes planning.
You always start with a <unk> an idea.
Then we have to combine the different photographs.
And here every piece is very well <unk>
If you do a good job when you take the pictures the result may be very beautiful and at the very realistic time.
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'm going to start showing a slide on a very boring technology.
Please, if you can <unk>
It's a diagram anybody that I took from a folder of mine.
I'm not very interested in showing you the details but the general aspect of the details.
This is a analysis that we were doing about the power of <unk> <unk> versus the power of local area networks.
What's interesting about this is that this one, as many other people that we tend to see, is a kind of a straight line on a logarithmic scale.
In other words, every step here represents an order of magnitude at the scale scale.
I'm going to talk about technology with <unk> <unk> is something new.
Here's something weird happening.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
Please light the lights.
<unk> more intensity because writing on paper.
Why are we <unk> technological curves on <unk> scales.
The answer is that if I draw them into a normal curve where, say, these are the years or some unit of time, and this would be any measure of the technology that I'd like to <unk> the diagram would look something ridiculous.
It would be something like this.
It doesn't tell a lot.
But if you look at that, for example, some other technology -- like transportation, on a <unk> curve, it would be very dumb, you'd see a straight line.
But if something like this, you have a <unk> change.
If the technology of the transport technology was as fast as <unk> past tomorrow we could take a taxi and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't go through that rhythm.
There is no <unk> in the history of technological development that every few years reverse orders of magnitude.
The question I want to pose is -- looking at these <unk> curves that we see they don't keep forever.
It's not possible to hold this change as fast as it goes.
It was one of two things.
Or it will be a typical <unk> I know like this until something completely different, or maybe I'll do something like this.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, so I think maybe something like this.
So we will now be in the middle of a transition.
In this line we're in a transition from what used to be the world, to a new form.
So what I'm trying to ask, and to ask myself, is, what is that new way <unk> the world?
Where new state is going.
The transition seems very, very <unk> if we are embedded in it.
I remember the future was happening in the year 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in the year 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future, and we see that the future is still the year 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has been <unk> year after year, along my life.
But I think it's because we feel something is going on.
What happens is a transformation. We can feel it.
And we know that it doesn't have a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years because everything will be so different than extrapolate what we're doing today doesn't make any sense.
So I want to talk to you about how it might be, how it might be, how that transition to <unk>
But to do that will have to talk a little bit about things that don't have much to do with technology and computer technology.
Because I think the only way to understand this is taking distance and looking at things in the long term.
The scale of time in which I would like to do this is the time of life on Earth.
I think this image makes sense if we look at each billion years.
So you go back about two billion years when the Earth was a big <unk> rock with a lot of chemicals that are <unk> around them.
If we look at the way that those chemicals were <unk> we give a sense of how things came along.
And I think there are theories to start to understand about the origin of RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this, and that is that, at that time, there was some <unk> of oil with all kinds of chemical recipes inside.
Some of those oil drops held a particular combination of chemicals that made them put materials out of the outside and so <unk> grew up.
And they started <unk>
In a sense, those were the most <unk> cell forms -- those oil <unk>
But those droplets weren't alive in the current sense, because each of them contained a random recipe of chemicals.
And every time they <unk> <unk> a <unk> distribution of chemicals that we <unk>
So every <unk> was a little bit different.
In fact, the drops that somehow <unk> being better at the time to bring the chemicals out, <unk> more, <unk> more chemicals and more <unk>
Often they were more and more <unk>
It was a way of life, a life form, very simple, but things became interesting when these drops the trick of abstraction.
Somehow we don't understand very well these <unk> they learned to store information.
They learned to put information, which was the recipe of the cell in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, <unk> in this particular evolution -- a writing system that allowed them to register what they were to be able to figure out what they were to be able to figure out.
The amazing thing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable since it evolved two billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes, have exactly the same code, that same writing system.
In fact, every living living is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did just by <unk> We can actually write things with this code.
Here I have 100 <unk> of the white dust that I try to hide the people at the airport.
But <unk> Tom this <unk> The code has the common letters that we tend to use in this -- and I wrote my personal data in this piece of DNA and put it 10 at 22 times.
So if anybody wants to have 100 million copies of my personal card -- I have a lot of for all the <unk> in fact, for every person in the world and it's here.
If it was a <unk> I would have put it into a virus and have spread it in the room.
What was the next <unk>
Writing DNA was an interesting step.
This caused these cells to be happy another billion years.
But then there was another big step in which things were <unk> very different and it was that these cells started to exchange and communicate information forming the communities of cells.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
So in that way, for example, <unk> resistance for antibiotics.
Some bacteria found the way they avoid penicillin and the <unk> to create their little DNA with other bacteria and now there's a lot of resistant to <unk> because bacteria communicate.
This communication gave rise to the communities that in a way, were together in that way, and established a <unk>
So we would <unk> or <unk> it together, or whether a community was very successful all of the individuals in that community were more and more <unk> by evolution.
And the inflection point happened when these communities came up so much that they actually came together and decided to write the whole recipe in the community board in a string of DNA.
The next interesting stage for life took another billion years.
And at that stage, we have communities, communities of many different kinds of cells working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells that don't just act alone.
The skin cell is not good without the heart, or the one of the muscles or the brain, and so on.
So these communities evolved and produced the most interesting levels that cell phone, something we call a organism.
The next level happened in these communities.
These started <unk>
And building very special structures that they didn't do more than process information in community.
These are <unk> structures.
<unk> are the appliances that process information that those cell communities built.
In fact, they started <unk> within community being responsible for <unk> understanding and transmit information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that moment as <unk> learning was confined to the duration of an organism, and not the period of evolutionary time.
So a organism, for example, learn not to eat some fruit because I knew bad and sick the last time that ate it.
That could happen during the life of an organism because they had built these data processing structures that for evolution would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by death of individuals who ate that fruit <unk>
So the fact that the nervous system would build those data structures to make it really advanced the evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now happen confined to an individual.
It could happen in the time necessary to learn.
But then, of course, individuals discovered the trick of communication.
So for example, the most <unk> version we know is human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea a <unk> idea in the head.
I'm here sitting here at some <unk> and hopefully building a similar idea, vague and <unk> in their heads that saved some analogy with mine.
But we take something very complicated to make it in sound, in sound sequences and produce something very complicated in another brain.
That now allows us to start working as a organism.
In fact, as humanity, we've started to perform <unk>
We now move through periods of similar periods to organisms -- <unk> our <unk> methods and information processing.
For example, the invention of language was a little step in that direction.
<unk> the computer <unk> the <unk> <unk> and so on, are the specialized mechanisms that we now build to manage that information.
And that brings us into something much larger, faster and able to evolve more than we did before.
Now evolution can happen in microseconds.
They already saw the evolutionary <unk> of <unk> where it produced some evolution of evolution with the <unk> program in front of our eyes.
And now we've accelerated the scales.
The first stages of the story that I told you to took a billion years ago each.
The next few of the nervous system and the brain took a few hundred million years old.
The <unk> and so on, took less than a million years.
And the next one, as the electronics, it seems to take only a few decades.
The process is <unk> I guess <unk> is the right word to name something that speeds up their own pace of change.
The more changes, the faster you do.
And I think that's what we see in this explosion of the curve.
We see the process <unk>
But I make my life designing computers and I know that the mechanisms that work for <unk> would not be possible without the recent academic advances.
But now design objects of such complexity, which would be impossible for me to engage in conventional ways.
I don't know that it makes every transistor on that machine connections.
There are billions.
Instead, with <unk> designers, we think about a level of abstraction, we put it on the machine and the machine with that does something that you couldn't get much further away and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes they use methods that we don't even understand well.
A particularly interesting method I've been using lately, is evolution itself.
We put it inside the machine an evolutionary process that operates at the scale of the microseconds.
And, for example, more extreme, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
And we say, "Please have a hundred million sets of instructions on <unk>
You could run these instructions at random, at random, running all those programs, and to take those of those <unk> to what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say I want to answer numbers, to put a simple example.
So we found the programs that are closer to tidying up numbers.
Of course, it's unlikely that some random sequences of instructions, <unk> numbers, so none of them did.
But luckily, he was able to put two numbers on the right order.
And I said, <unk> could you take 10 percent of those random sequences that you can do the <unk>
They <unk> those and <unk> the rest.
And now we're going to find that the best <unk> of the numbers.
And let's go back to <unk> following a process of analog to <unk>
Let's take two programs, that we <unk> children, who <unk> <unk> and the children will <unk> the properties of two programs.
So we got a new generation of software programs that had a little more success.
And we say, "Please repeat <unk>
<unk> again.
We were going to have some mutations in it.
And it tries to do again and try again with another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes, or a few minutes, in a few minutes, in a few hours.
In the end, we ended up with programs that are really perfect in the <unk>
In fact, they're much more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't tell you how they work.
I've tried to analyze them to see how they work.
These are dark <unk>
But they play the <unk>
In fact, I know, I have the security that they get the goal because they come from a lineage of hundreds of thousands of programs that would do it.
In fact, their lives are dependent on this.
I was once in a 747 with <unk> <unk> and he takes a card and says, "Look at this.
He says, <unk> plane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> who work together to offer a <unk> flight, doesn't make you feel <unk>
We know that engineering processes don't work very well when they become complicated.
So we started to rely on computers to make very different design processes.
And that allows us to produce a lot more complex than that produces normal engineering.
However, we don't understand the whole options that you are.
In that sense, it goes in front of us.
Now we use those programs to make computers much faster and so that we can run these programs much more quickly.
I mean, they <unk>
The thing goes faster and faster and so I think it looks so <unk>
Because all these technologies are <unk>
We're <unk>
And we're at a moment in analog to the <unk> organisms when they became <unk>
We are the <unk> and we can't understand what the hell are we creating.
We're at the tipping point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant in our part of thinking that we are the final product of evolution.
And I think we all are part of the creation of what it comes to come.
But now comes lunch and I think stop here before I <unk>
I think we have to do something with a part of medical culture that has to change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've spent time enough to let me give you part of my fake <unk> in that.
Before I deal with my talk, to talk a little bit about baseball.
Why not?
We are near the end of the end of the World <unk>
We love baseball, right?
<unk> is full of amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's because of <unk> <unk> talks about statistics and use them to form a great baseball.
I will focus on one of them and I hope many of you have heard about it.
It's called average <unk>
And we talked about 300 percent of a <unk> that I <unk> 300.
That means that the bat <unk> three of 10 times.
That means to launch the ball to the game without being <unk> and that anyone who tries to <unk> the first base -- it doesn't get time, and the second base will be <unk>
Three <unk> <unk>
You know how to call a <unk> <unk>
Well, really well, maybe the team of stars.
You know how to call a baseball <unk>
By the way, that's someone who 10 <unk> gets four.
<unk> like the legendary Ted Williams, the last player in the League of <unk> in running more 400 strikes in a regular off-season.
Now I put this to my world of medicine where I feel much more comfortable or maybe less awkward, after what I'm going to tell you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and they're <unk> to a surgeon who has also a record of 400 in <unk>
It doesn't work, right?
Now suppose that they live in a remote place and a beloved self has two clogged arteries and her family doctor is derived to a cardiologist whose record is <unk>
But you know what?
She's getting better.
And its hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But I'm going to ask you question.
What do you think should be the average of the hits of a heart or a heart surgeon or a nurse or a <unk> <unk>
1,000, good.
And the truth of the issue is that no one in medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon, a doctor or a <unk>
What we do, however, is sending them to the world, and I would include with the <unk>
You never, ever make a mistake and try to figure out how to do it right.
That was the message I <unk> when I was in medical school.
I was a <unk> <unk>
Once, one fellow in high school said that Brian Goldman <unk> to a blood test.
<unk>
<unk> in my little <unk> in the nurses of the General <unk> Hospital is not far from here.
And I learned all memory.
From my kind of anatomy, <unk> the origin and muscle work, the <unk> of every artery that comes out of the <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk>
And I even knew the <unk> diagnosis about how to classify <unk> <unk> <unk>
And while we get more and more knowledge.
And I was very right; I graduated from <unk>
And <unk> of medical school with the impression that if you <unk> everything, then you would know everything, or as possible, close to everything, because I get rid of the mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met Mrs. <unk>
I was a resident in a college hospital here, in Toronto, when they brought the emergency lady to the emergency service where I worked.
At the time, I was assigned to <unk> service.
And when the emergency room requested to go to a cardiologist to go to that patient.
And they report to the head of detail.
When I saw Mrs. <unk> I was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when the <unk> I heard a <unk> sound on both sides -- which gave me a heart heart failure.
In these conditions the heart stops working and instead of pump the blood forward, blood is going to our lungs, these are <unk> and that's why it's difficulty breathing.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did it and I started working on the treatment that I was <unk>
I gave him <unk> and medication to alleviate the pressure in your heart.
I gave him <unk> <unk> so that he could get liquid down.
And in an hour or two, she started feeling better.
And I felt very good.
And there was when I made the first <unk> he sent her back home.
I actually made two more mistakes more.
He sent her home without talking to the head of detail.
I didn't have the phone I didn't do what I should have done, I was calling my boss and <unk> with him for the <unk>
And if my head would have seen, would have been able to bring <unk> information.
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
I may not want to be a resident to make constant care.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to take care that I could take care of my patients without even contact with my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
When I send her home, I didn't take attention to a voice in my inner voice that said, <unk> is not a good idea. I don't know it.
In fact, it was so insecure that I was asked to ask the nurse that he would get to Mrs. <unk> "Do you think he's okay if he goes to her <unk>
And the nurse thought, and then he said with total <unk> "Yeah, I think being okay."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So he was signed up and the ambulance together with the ambulance and they took her home.
And I went back to the hospital room.
The rest of that day, I had a bad <unk> in the stomach.
But I kept on my work.
At the end of the day, I <unk> to leave the hospital and I walked into the parking lot where my car was to go home. And I did something I didn't do normally,
It was in the emergency service of the road service.
And there is another nurse, not that I was talking about Mrs. <unk> before, but the other one said to me three words, those three words that most emergency doctors were <unk>
Other specialists are afraid of it, but there's a <unk> in <unk> and it is that we see <unk> patients.
The three words, does it remember you?
<unk> of the patient who sent her <unk>
I asked the other nurse with total <unk>
"Well, she <unk> with the same <unk>
She was fine.
But I went back and on the edge of death.
At the time of an hour to have come home to her house, after I gave him the high school, he suffered a collapse and her family called the <unk> the ambulance <unk> they brought her to the emergency room with a blood pressure from 50 millimeters to <unk> which means a shock shock <unk>
I was barely breathing and I was blue.
The emergency staff would <unk> all their resources.
They gave them medication to raise your blood pressure.
And they put a <unk> artificial <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the core.
He had a mixture of feelings because after the <unk> was in intensive care therapy and waiting for all hope that they were <unk>
And in the two or three days it was clear that they never <unk>
He had permanent damage.
The family got together together.
And at eight or nine days, they were <unk> what was happening.
And at the ninth day, I let her go. <unk> wife, mother and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names of the people who die.
That was my first experience.
So the weeks later, I was excited about it, and I experienced for the first time <unk> shame that exists in our medical culture, and I sat alone, <unk> without feeling that healthy shame because you can't get your colleagues.
You make peace and it never makes that mistake.
It's the shame that leaves a teaching.
<unk> shame is that it makes us feel very bad inside.
It's the one that tells us that what we did was wrong, but we're bad.
And that felt.
And it wasn't my <unk> he was a <unk>
I talked to the family, and I am sure I would take things out and made sure that I didn't help me.
And I kept getting those questions.
Why didn't I ask my <unk> Why did he sent her to her home?
And in my worst <unk> why made a mistake so <unk>
Why did I choose medicine?
Little <unk> that feeling was <unk>
And I began to feel better.
And on one day <unk> was opened the sky and finally came out the sky, and I wondered if I would feel better again.
And I made a deal with myself in which if we were to take the efforts to be perfect for not making more errors, make those voices from the voices.
And it did.
I went back to work.
But it came back again.
Two years later, I was an effort in the emergency department in a community hospital north of Toronto, and I got a <unk> man with a pain in <unk>
I was very busy and <unk>
And he pointed out here.
I watched it was a little bit <unk>
He was <unk> penicillin and he sent him home.
But while he was headed to the door was still pointing out his <unk>
Two days later, when I came to do my guard, my boss asked to talk to me <unk> in his office.
And I gave the three words: you remember you?
Remember the patient who saw a pain in <unk>
Well, he came back and I didn't have a <unk> <unk>
It had potentially mortal condition called <unk>
You can search for Google -- it's an infection, not because it's <unk> and it can cause the close of those tracks.
He said, fortunately, she didn't die.
They are <unk> antibiotics on <unk> and recovered in the few days.
And I went through the same time of shame and <unk> then I went back and returned to work, until it happened again and again, and again.
Two times in the same <unk> <unk> not <unk> <unk>
And it's a great effort, especially working in a hospital, because they were <unk> at 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought I had a <unk> calculation of it.
<unk> an X-ray X-ray -- but it turned out a colleague who was checking the patient <unk> some sensitivity to the lower right and called a surgeon.
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea.
I read liquid order to <unk> and I asked my colleague who was <unk>
I checked it up and noticed a subject in the lower right-hand corner, called the surgeon <unk>
Both were operated in and recovered <unk>
But every single case was <unk> to me.
But I'd like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise and like a lot of colleagues say, it's a <unk>
The most significant have been for the last five years.
<unk> embarrassed and without support.
And here's the problem: If I can't go and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the <unk> that tells me what really happens, how can I share this with my <unk>
How I show you this so that they don't make the same <unk>
If I would go to a place like this, I wouldn't have any idea what you think of me.
When was the last time you heard someone will talk about failure, after failure, after failure?
Of course in a party you'll hear about the mistakes of other doctors, but you don't hear somebody talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues as well, that a <unk> in my hospital <unk> the wrong leg -- I believe it would have a hard time to look at your eyes.
This is the system that we have.
<unk> of all mistakes.
It's the system where there are two <unk> the ones that make mistakes and the ones who can't sleep and the ones that you can't sleep, and the ones that have <unk> and the ones that have great outcomes.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction as antibodies who start to attack that person.
We have the idea that if you raise medicine to people who make mistakes, we will become a safe system.
But it brings two problems.
In 20 years of diffusion and independent journalism, I've done a personal study of bad medical care, and errors in doctors to learn how much as I wrote to Toronto, Star <unk> white, <unk> Black <unk> white, white, <unk> art.
And what I learned is that mistakes are <unk>
We work in a system where mistakes are happening every day, where one in 10 drugs <unk> in the hospital are wrong, or <unk> is not correct. In a system that infection <unk> are more and more <unk> causing chaos and death.
In this country, 5,000 people were dying Canadian for medical <unk>
The U.S. Cancer Institute set up 100,000.
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we should.
And that's how things are.
A <unk> system where knowledge will be divided every two or three years, and we don't <unk>
<unk> sleep deprivation.
We can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow a perfect history of a patient with pain in the chest.
Now, let's take the same patient with a pain in the chest, it comes <unk> with <unk> eyes, and with breath to alcohol and, suddenly, my story was <unk> from contempt.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't make things always the same.
And my patients are not <unk> they don't <unk> their symptoms always the same way.
All of this, mistakes are inevitable.
So if we take the system as we were <unk> and we eliminate all the professional professionals who are prone to error, you know, no one.
And with respect to that people don't want to talk about their <unk>
In my <unk> <unk> white, <unk> art -- it's a custom to say, "This is my worst <unk> I would say to everyone, from the <unk> to the head of surgery, <unk> -- "This is my worst <unk> blah blah blah -- "What are your <unk> and <unk> the microphone into them.
And their students were <unk> <unk> and down the head and <unk> saliva and start telling their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
You can say, "Look, not make the same <unk>
They need a context where we can do it.
They need a <unk> medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The <unk> physician is human, it's human, they accept it, and they're not proud of their mistakes, but it tries to learn from what's happened to teach others.
They take their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
<unk> the mistakes of other people not with intention of <unk> but in a loving way and support for everybody to <unk>
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that humans run the system, and when this happens, they make mistakes once in time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk> doctor.
I'm a human, a <unk>
And I feel so much but I strive to learn something that can convey to others.
I don't know what about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words, I remember.
Do you know how many decisions we take a <unk>
Do you know how much we choose a week?
I recently did a survey over 2,000 people and the average amount of choices that says, pick an American American -- it's about 70 a day.
It doesn't do a lot, in a research for a group of CEOs of businesses.
The researchers recorded the different <unk> tasks of these executives and the time that we were trying to make decisions about those tasks.
They found that, on average, <unk> <unk> jobs a week.
Naturally, every work included lots of <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Only 12 percent required an hour or more of your time.
Now think about their choices.
You know how many people are in the category of nine minutes, and how many of the <unk>
How are the way the way they deal with these decisions?
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of <unk> to choose to the <unk>
I want to talk about the problem and about possible solutions.
As I talk about this, I'm going to ask you a few questions and I need to know their answers.
When you ask a question, like I'm blind, raise your hand only if you want to burn calories.
Otherwise, when you ask a question, if your answer is positive please give you a <unk>
And now my first question of the day, you're ready to hear the problem of the <unk> <unk> problem.
Thank you.
Being a graduate student at Stanford University, <unk> this particular level of the very, very <unk> level at least in that era was very sophisticated.
His name was <unk>
It was almost like going to a <unk> park.
There were like 250 different mustard classes and <unk> over 500 different kinds of fruit and vegetables and about 25 percent of the <unk> and this was when we were taking water from the tap.
I loved going to that store, but I was asking myself, why never buy nothing?
This is the shelf of oil oil.
They had more than 75 different classes, including those who were in <unk> box that came from trees.
I once decided to visit the manager and said, <unk> this strategy to offer all these <unk>
He pointed to me the buses full of tourists that came every day, usually with their cameras.
We decided to do a little experiment with <unk>
<unk> hall.
They had <unk> different classes.
I put a place to get it right to the entrance to the shop.
We put out six <unk> or 24 flavors and different flavors and we looked at two things: First, where people were willing to stop stopping the <unk>
More people stopped when I had a <unk> 60 percent that when I was just six, about 40 percent.
We also looked at what case they were more likely to buy a coffee <unk>
So here we find the opposite effect.
Of the ones that stopped when he had only three percent of three percent of them got to buy <unk>
Of those who stood up when I had six, we saw 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, people had six times more likely to buy <unk> if they found six.
Well, decide that we don't buy <unk> we will probably be <unk> <unk> it's good to keep the <unk> but it turns out that the problem of the <unk> of choices affects us in a good <unk> decisions.
We decided to not decide, even when this is not <unk>
Now the subject of the day, the financial savings.
I'm going to describe a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we see the security decisions for the retirement of about a million Americans, from about a million Americans, from a few dozen Americans, from this country.
We were interested in seeing if the number of commercial <unk> available for savings plans for retirement, the <unk> program to save people to save for the future.
And we discovered that there was actually a <unk>
We had <unk> plans to go from two to 59 options.
We found that the larger number of funding was <unk> there were less participation.
So if you look at the extreme, we see that in the plans that offer two funds, the rate of participation was from 70 percent or more, not as high as it was.
And in the plans that was offered about 60 funds, the rate of participation came to the <unk> <unk>
It turns out, even if you decide to participate, when there's more choices, even in that case, there are negative consequences.
So for those who decided to participate, the more it was the number of options, more people will be engaged by avoiding stocks or hedge funds.
In the time there were more options, they were more willing to invest in market financial accounts.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we <unk> to optimize the future financial well-being.
In the previous decade we've seen three major negative consequences by offering more and more possibilities.
The most likely thing is that <unk> the decision, that <unk> even when it goes against the self-interest.
It's more likely to take the worst decisions in finance and health.
They're more likely to pick things less <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The main reason is that we have to look at that broad variety of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations for <unk> and to choose that awesome <unk>
Today I want to show you four simple techniques that we've <unk> in one way or another, in different research, so that they can test in their business.
The first is, <unk>
You've heard it before, but it has never been more true than today, less than the more.
People are always upset when I say, <unk>
Do you care about losing space in <unk>
But actually what we're seeing more and more is that if you choose to cut, get rid of <unk> options, there will be an increase in sales, <unk> the costs, there will be a better experience in choice.
When <unk> & <unk> went from 26 different types of <unk> & <unk> 15, you saw a 10 percent increase in sales.
When Golden Gate corporation -- eliminated the products for <unk> who are less <unk> increased <unk> in <unk> for two major sales and lower costs.
You know today's supermarkets, on average about 100,000 products.
In a pirate store, there's about 100,000 products.
But the ninth store in the current world is <unk> and he offers just 1,400 <unk> a kind of tomato sauce <unk>
In the world savings world, I think one of the best examples that have come out about how to handle the best choices is the <unk> David <unk>
All the Harvard employees are <unk> automatically to a safe insurance background.
The people who are really willing to choose -- they give them 20 funding, not 300 or more.
They already know that people say, "I don't know how to <unk>
They're all <unk>
The first thing I do is ask <unk> <unk> the differences there are among those options.
And if their employees can't afford it, they can't do their <unk>
This afternoon, before I started this session, I was talking to <unk>
He told me that they would be willing to offer people in this audience with all paid to the most beautiful road in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want they read it.
I'm going to leave you a few seconds to <unk> and then I want to give you a round of applause. If you're ready to take the <unk>
<unk> <unk> Okay. Anyone who's ready to accept the deal.
They're not else?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a <unk>
Who is ready for that <unk>
I think I actually hit my own <unk>
All right.
In fact, you had more information on the first <unk> than in the second, but I can tell you that they thought the second time was more real.
Because the images made it look more real.
This leads me to the second technique to handle the problem of the <unk> of options.
For people to understand the differences between choices, they have to understand the consequences of each option, and that the consequences must feel very differently in a very specific way.
Why is people spending 15 percent more on average when they use debit cards or credit cards that when it uses <unk>
Because it doesn't look like real money.
It turns out to make it look more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to get more.
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> <unk> who worked on <unk> these people were in a meeting where they were being touched by a <unk> plan.
At that meeting, that we would describe exactly like <unk> <unk> did a little <unk>
What we added was that it would take the staff to think of the positive things that they would <unk> in their lives if they were saving more money.
With this <unk> there was an increase in the <unk> of 20 percent and an increase in how much they were interested in saving or in what they wanted to put in their bank <unk> <unk>
The third technique is <unk>
We can handle more categories than we need options.
For example, this is a study we did in a <unk> <unk>
We saw that in the retail supermarket <unk> along the corridor of <unk> the exhibition of magazines can hold from <unk> different types to <unk>
But you know?
Because <unk> tells me how to <unk>
These are two <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other, <unk>
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the right on the right is <unk> give a <unk>
<unk> <unk> Well, there's a few of them.
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the right on the right is <unk> give a <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the right on the right is <unk> but you know what?
This <unk> framework is completely useless.
The categories must tell you something that we were going to say not to the <unk>
You often see this problem with those huge <unk>
I was supposed to know who are <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out that we can handle a lot more information than we think, if you just <unk> it a little bit.
We need to increase the gradually.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's look at a good decision <unk> buy a car.
This is a German German manufacturer for <unk>
You have to take 60 decisions to put your car.
And these decisions vary in the number of choices that each one offers each.
I have 56 choices.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
So what I'm going to do is change the order that the decisions make us.
So half of the customers are going to go from lots of choices, 56 colors, just about four boxes.
The other half of customers are going to go from a few choices, four <unk> by 56 colors, lots of choices.
And what am I going to <unk>
So what are you so <unk>
If you <unk> always the default button in every decision, it indicates that they're <unk> or <unk> we're <unk>
We found that the ones that go from a lot of choices, to <unk> the <unk> button and again, and another one.
The <unk>
If you go from a few choices to many, they continue there.
The same information, the same number of options.
The only thing I did was to disrupt the order in which the information is.
If we start with the easy, you learn to <unk>
Even though the choice box does not say anything about the preferences of inner <unk> in all ways we would choose to choose.
We are excited about a product that we're building that now has more <unk> with the process.
To sum up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of the <unk> <unk> problem -- <unk> <unk> <unk> we can make it <unk> <unk> we can handle more categories with less <unk> <unk> complexity.
All these techniques that I showed you were designed to help manage the <unk> or better for you, to use them in their business, or for people who work.
It's that I think the key to the best of a choice is being careful about <unk>
And the more careful we are in our best choices we can do to practice the <unk>
Thank you very much.
In the <unk> years in the East Germany, <unk> if you had a typewriter I had to get them to the government.
I had to register a piece of text that was written with the machine.
And this is why the government could track the origin of the texts.
If they found a script with the wrong message, they could track the footprint up to the origin of the idea.
In the West, we don't think that someone could do this, so much that this would lead to the freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser printer, you buy any big manufacturer of any big manufacturer and print a page, that page will end up having some yellow yellow dots on each page that follow a pattern that makes you <unk>
That's happening today.
And no one seems to be <unk> so much for this.
This is an example of the ways our governments use technology against us, the citizens.
And it's one of the top three main causes of problems in the network.
If you look at what happens in the online world, we can build the attacks according to their <unk>
There are three main groups there.
They're the <unk>
Like Mr. <unk> <unk> in Ukraine.
<unk> cell phone is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use <unk> to earn a lot of money, large numbers.
There are really many cases of online <unk> <unk> that would make money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthieu <unk> <unk> etc., etc., etc.
These guys are doing their online <unk> but they do it by illegal media by <unk> banking to steal money from our accounts when we buy them in <unk> or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we bought on a <unk> computer.
The secret secret <unk> two months ago, <unk> the Swiss account of this guy, Sam <unk> and this account had <unk> million dollars when it was frozen <unk>
Mr. <unk> is <unk> they don't know his <unk>
And I say today it's more likely than any of us to be victim of a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is going to be wrong with worse.
In the future, most crime crimes online.
The second group of <unk> in terms that we see today is not driven by money.
There's another thing that moves, they motivate them the protests, they motivate them to motivate the views, the laughs of laughter.
Groups like Anonymous have <unk> in the last 12 months occupying a leading role in the online attacks.
Those are the three main <unk> the criminals who do for money, the <unk> like Anonymous who do to protest and the last group are the United States of the United States that <unk>
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of government attack, against its own citizens.
<unk> is an authority from <unk> or indeed it was.
<unk> the <unk> last fall because of a <unk>
<unk> the safety of the site and hit a <unk>
Last week, I said, in a meeting with representatives of the Dutch government, I asked one of the leaders if they were <unk> <unk> death of people because of the attack to <unk>
And the answer of him was yes.
So how do people die of an attack from these?
<unk> is an <unk> authority.
<unk> <unk>
Why do you make the <unk>
Well, you need to have a website that has a website with <unk> services, services like <unk>
Except that <unk> a foreign foreign authority.
And that would be <unk> <unk>
And in the case of <unk> it happened exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt at the <unk> protesters headquarters in April <unk> 2011, and during the building of the building, they found a lot of papers.
Among those papers was this folder called <unk>
And within that folder there were notes from a company based in Germany that had been sold by the Egyptian Egyptian government that had been sold to <unk> the communications of citizens of the country.
They had sold this tool for 280 euros to the <unk> government.
The company headquarters is right here.
I mean, Western governments provide tools to the governments that provide us tools to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments are also doing this.
For example, in Germany, only a couple weeks ago, I found the <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by the German government officials to investigate their own citizens.
If you're <unk> in a criminal case -- well, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But today it goes over there.
It <unk> the Internet connection.
<unk> even tools like <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all communication, and listen to the discussions online, to get our data.
When we think carefully about things like these the obvious response should be said, "Well, it looks like something wrong, but it doesn't really affect me because I'm an honest citizen.
Why is it <unk>
I have nothing to do <unk>
And that argument makes no sense.
It's in play privacy.
Privacy is not <unk>
It's not a matter of privacy against security.
It's about freedom against control.
If we could be trust in our governments today in 2011, any right that you will spend today, it will be forever.
<unk> blindly in any future government, in a administration that could be within 50 years?
These are the questions that have to worry about the next 50 years.
This is where I live. I live in Kenya, in the southern National Park in Nairobi.
These are the cows of my dad, the background, and behind the cows, the National Park of Nairobi.
The National Park in Nairobi has no fences at the majority of the south, which means that wild animals like <unk> migrate into the park.
And predators, like the lions, they follow them, and this is what they do.
<unk> our cattle.
This is one of the ones that killed at night, and as soon as we wake up in the morning and we found it very bad, because it was the only <unk> we had.
My community, the <unk> we think we came from the sky with our animals and all the land to <unk> and so we value it so much.
So I grew up <unk> a lot of <unk>
They were dying of the warriors who protect our community and cattle, and they're also angry with the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions that killed in Nairobi.
I think this is so few in the National Park of Nairobi.
A kid in my community, at six to nine years is responsible for the livestock of his father and this was the same thing that happened to me.
So I had to find a way to solve this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought of lions I would give them fear.
But I realized that actually this was not <unk> because even helped lions see the pen away.
I don't love <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
She was trying to trick the lions so they believed it was near the <unk>
But male lions are very intelligent.  They came the first day and saw the <unk> and they were like, but the second day, they came back and said, this thing is not moving, it's always here.  So he jumped and killed animals.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and that day lions didn't come out.
I found that male lions are afraid to light that moves.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch with that to turn out the lights.
And this is a little lamp of a <unk> <unk>
<unk> everything.
As you can see, the solar panel load the battery and the battery <unk> the electricity into the small box <unk> I call it a transformative.
And the <unk> box makes the lights <unk>
As you can see, the <unk> get out there, because that's where the lions.
And this is how they see the lions when they come from night.
The lights <unk> and <unk> lions so you think I'm walking through the <unk> but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my house two years ago, and since then, we never went back to have trouble with lions.
And the neighborhood houses heard the idea.
One of them is from this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals to have killed the lions and asked me if I could put the lights.
I said yes.
You can <unk> you see the background, these are the lights in the lions.
Since then, I've installed these in seven houses in my community, and they're serving very much.
And my idea is also used now throughout Kenya, <unk> other predators like <unk> <unk> and it's also being used for <unk> of the farms.
Thanks to this invention, I was fortunate enough to get a scholarship to one of the best schools in Kenya, <unk> International School, and I'm very excited.
My new school is now helping to raise funding and <unk>
It even took my friends to my community and installed lights in the houses that they don't have, and I teach them how to <unk>
So a year ago, I was just a kid in <unk> of the savanna <unk> the cows of my father, and I used to be able to fly, and he said it would someday be inside of you.
And here I am.
I got the opportunity to come in plane for the first time to TED.
My great dream is to be an engineer of aviation and a pilot when I grow up.
I used to hate the lions, but now as my invention is saving the cows of my dad and lions, we can be with lions without any conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my tongue means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture how exciting it is to hear a story like you.
So you get a <unk> Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: You're working on other electrical <unk>
What's the next thing in your <unk>
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to do a close electrical <unk> CA: A near <unk>
<unk> I know you have invented electric fences -- but I want to do my own.
CA: I mean, you know, once, <unk> and <unk> <unk> I've tried it before, but I stopped because I got a <unk>  CA: <unk> <unk> Richard <unk> are a big thing.
We're going to <unk> every step that <unk> friend of mine.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was a little, I thought my country was the best on the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called "No <unk>
And I felt very proud.
In school, we spent all the time studying the story of Kim <unk> but we never learned a lot of the rest of the world, except that America, South Korea, Japan are the enemies.
But sometimes I wondered about the rest of the world, I thought I would spend my entire life in North Korea, until all of it changed <unk>
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public run.
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family wasn't poor and I was never hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my sister.
That said, "When we put this -- the five members of the family will stop in this world, because we haven't eaten in the two past weeks.
We are <unk> together on the ground, and our bodies are so weak, we're ready to die."
I was very altered.
It was the first time I heard people were suffering in my country.
<unk> when I was walking in front of the train station, I saw something terrible I can't erase my memory.
One woman without life was dead in the street, holding a child <unk> in her arms watching his mother face without being able to do anything.
Nobody <unk> because they were very concerned about taking care of them and their families.
A huge famine <unk> North Korea <unk> in the <unk>
In the end, over a million North Koreans died during famine and only a few survived eating grass, insects and <unk>
They also became more and more <unk> the energy <unk> all around me was completely dark at night except by the sea lights in China, just crossing the river from my house.
I always asked myself why they had light and we don't.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea at night compared to the neighboring countries.
This is the <unk> River, which is the boundary between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, allowing North Koreans, to cross <unk>
But many of them die.
Sometimes, I saw bodies floating in the river, <unk>
I can't reveal the details of how I left North Korea, but I can only say that for the years of famine I was sent to China to live with relatives <unk>
But I just thought I'd be separate from my family for a short time.
I could never have imagined it would take 14 years to live together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea how life would be like refugee <unk>
But soon I learned that it's not only <unk> but it's also dangerous because the refugees North America were considered illegal <unk>
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible fate of a turn in North Korea.
One day, my worst nightmare was actually made when I was arrested by the Chinese police and hit the police station.
Somebody had been accused by being <unk> then I <unk> my skills in the Chinese language, and they asked me a lot of questions.
I was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to explode.
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to end.
But I was able to control my emotions and answered the questions.
At the end of the <unk> a official said to another, "This was a fake <unk> she's not <unk>
And let me go. That's a miracle.
Some North Koreans in China are looking for asylum <unk>
But many people can be arrested by Chinese police and <unk>
These women were very lucky.
Although there were eventually released from a hard international pressure.
These North Koreans were not so lucky.
Every year, countless Koreans are captured in China and <unk> to North Korea, where they're <unk> incarcerated or executed in public.
Although I was lucky to get a lot of other Koreans haven't had so much luck.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard to survive.
Even after learning a new language and find work, all of the world can be <unk> in a second.
That's why after 10 years of hiding my identity, I decided to be a risk going to South Korea going to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
<unk> in South Korea was a much greater challenge than I had expected.
English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
Also, I understood that there was a big gap between North and South.
We're all <unk> but inside, we have become very different because of 67 years of <unk>
Even I went through an identity.
I'm a <unk> or a <unk>
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly, there was no country that I could call with a pride of mine.
Even though I went to life in South Korea wasn't easy, I did a plan. I started studying for the exam of income to college.
Just when I was starting to <unk> my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korean authorities had a little bit of money that I sent to my family, and as blame -- my family was going to be shifted to the force to a location of the way outside the <unk>
They had to flee it away.
So I started planning how to help them escape.
North Koreans have to travel long distances on the road towards freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea.
So, ironically, I took a flight to China and went to the border of North Korea.
Because my family couldn't speak Chinese, I had to <unk> it somehow, for over 3,000 miles through China and then across Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> took a week, and we were almost caught several times.
Once, our bus was arrested and <unk> by a Chinese Chinese officer.
He asked the tea <unk> and he started asking them questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be arrested.
When the Chinese officer came up to my family, <unk> I stood up and told him that they were <unk> people who was <unk>
He looked at me <unk> but fortunately I believed me.
We did all the way down to the border of <unk>
But I had to spend almost all my money to bribe the guards <unk> in <unk>
But even after spending the border, my family was arrested and locked across the border of <unk>
After paying <unk> and bribes, my family was released in a month.
But at the time, my family was arrested and incarcerated again in the capital of <unk>
This was one of the lowest points in my life.
I did all for free my family, and we were so close to it, but my family was <unk> in prison as short distance from the embassy of South Korea.
I was going to come into the <unk> office and the police station, desperately trying to release my family.
But I didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that time, or the voice of a man saying, "What is the problem?"
I was so surprised that an unknown would love to ask.
With my poor man, and with a dictionary, I told him the situation, and without <unk> the man went to the ATM and gave me the rest of the money for my family and another two North Koreans and to take them out of prison.
I took my whole heart, and I said, "Why do I get <unk>
"I'm not <unk> I told you.
"I am helping the village <unk>
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The kind of unknown <unk> a new hope for me and for the village to <unk> when more <unk>
And I showed me that the kindness of strangers and the international community are really the <unk> of hope that the people would have <unk> needs.
Over time, after our long journey, my family and I met in South Korea, as well.
But achieving their freedom is only half the battle.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families and when they <unk> a new country, they start with a little bit of money.
So we can benefit from the international community in education, the practice of the English community of the English <unk> and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people in North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because many of us are still in contact with family still inside, and we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from within.
I've been very <unk> I've gotten a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help North Koreans -- an opportunity to thrive with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North Koreans <unk> around the world, including at the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in South America.
This is <unk> <unk> grocery stores, fast food, <unk> land.
So the planners of the city came together, and they thought, "We're going to change the South <unk> name to represent something more, so they changed the South Angeles and South Angeles as if this is <unk> what's actually wrong in the city.
This is the South Angeles   <unk> of <unk> fast foods, <unk>
Just like <unk> millions of other Americans, live in a food in food, Los Angeles <unk> home to the food places to get and eating in the car.
The curious thing is that food places to bring people kill more people than food in the car.
People are dying of <unk> diseases in Los Angeles and South America.
For example, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times larger than say, Beverly <unk> who's like 15 miles away.
I was glad to see this happen.
And I ask myself, how would you feel if you didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time you go home you see the <unk> effects that today's food system has in your <unk>
I see chairs of wheels and sold as a self-driving cars.
I see <unk> centers like <unk>
And I consider this to stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
The food is the problem, and it's the solution.
And I just got tired of running 45 minutes back and back to buy an apple that doesn't have pesticides.
What I did, was planting a food forest in front of my house.
In a sliver of land we call a <unk>
It's about 45 me three feet.
The point is, he belongs to the city.
But you have to follow it.
I said, "Well, I can do what comes to me in wins, because it's my responsibility and I have to <unk>
So it was how I ended up maintaining it.
So my group and I, L.A. Green <unk> we put together and we started planting our food forest food, <unk> <unk> you know, the nine full vegetables live.
What we do, we are kind of a group of <unk> <unk> made up by gardeners of all the <unk> across the city and completely volunteer, and all we do is for free.
And the garden, was beautiful.
Then someone gets <unk>
The city is set to me, and in short, they gave me a <unk> saying that I had to remove my garden, the <unk> made <unk>
And I said, "Come on to me, right?
A <unk> order to plant food on a piece of land that no one <unk>  So I was like, "Well, <unk>
Because this time wasn't going to happen.
L.A. was written by Steve <unk> and I talked to the <unk> and one of the Green members who put a request in <unk> with 900 <unk> we were a success.
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called me <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, come on, why not?
L.A. is the city of the U.S. <unk>
It's <unk>
That's about 20 Central <unk>
That's enough space to plant <unk> millions of <unk> plants.
Why on Earth do it not look like this?
<unk> a plant to give a thousand, 10,000 seeds.
When a dollar of <unk> will give you 75 dollars of a result.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, cultivate your own food.
<unk> your own food is like print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for the South <unk>
I grew up there, <unk> my kids there.
I became part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for me for others, and I'm going to manufacture my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I farming my art.
As a <unk> artist who <unk> walls, I <unk> soils, <unk>
I use the garden, the land, like a piece of canvas, and the plants and the trees, are my <unk> of that canvas.
You can see what the Earth can do. If you let it be their canvas.
You simply can't imagine how amazing it is <unk> and how it affects people.
What happened?
I witnessed how my garden became a tool of education in the transformation of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the land.
We are the land.
It was <unk> to see how kids affect guys.
<unk> is the most <unk> act and provocative act that you can do, especially in a <unk>
Also, they get <unk>
And I remember one occasion, that came a mother and his daughter, were like the <unk> at night and they were in my yard, salt and looked very <unk>
I, well, man, I felt bad that they were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this like this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame when I see people who were so close to me with hungry, and this just reinforces why I do this, people ask me, <unk> don't temes people go to steal your <unk>
I say, "Oh my God, I'm not afraid they're going to be <unk>
That's why it's on the street.
That's what it's about.
I want you to <unk> but at the time, I want you to <unk> your <unk>
There was another occasion where I put a garden in a shelter to <unk> in downtown Los Angeles.
They were these guys, who helped me download the truck.
It was great, they gave me his stories about how it had affected and how they used to plant with their mom and her grandmother, and it was great to see how the changed, so it was just for a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 <unk>
We've had a lot of 50 people who are coming, work and <unk> every plan for volunteer.
If kids are growing up, they will eat <unk>
If none of the <unk> will eat <unk>  But if none of this is <unk> if you don't teach them how food affects your mind and the body, they eat blind to put them in front of you.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing in which they're pregnant. I see some of the color of color that are on this path that they designed for them, that doesn't take them nowhere.
With the <unk> I see an opportunity where we can train these kids who are <unk> from their communities to have a sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe the next George Washington <unk>
But if we don't change the composition of the land, we never will.
Now this is one of my agenda, this is something I want to do.
I want to plant a whole block of gardens, where people can share food in the same block.
I want to take over and turn them into your healthy.
I don't <unk>
I'm not talking about it for free, because the free is not sustainable.
The curious thing about sustainability, is you have to <unk>
What I'm talking about is to get people working on the street, to get the kids out of the street, who know the joy, the pride and the honor to grow their own food, opening of farmers.
What I want to do here, we have to make it sexy.
I want everybody to become <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We have to change the script of what's a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
Do you get them to take your <unk> right?
That is the weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet with me, well, if you want to see me, I don't call me if you want to sit in comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk about doing some <unk> to talk about doing some shit.
If you want to see me, come to the garden with your <unk> so we can plant something.
<unk> Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>  You probably all agree with me that this is a very nice road here.
It's made of <unk> and the asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially in days as today, where it rains a lot.
You can have a lot of water in the asphalt that we <unk>
And especially if you have <unk> on your bike, and these cars go -- it's not really nice.
Also, the asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a noisy material, and if we build roads, like the Netherlands, far close to cities, we would want a quiet road there.
The solution for that is to do <unk> roads.
The asphalt is a material that we use now in most of the roads from the Netherlands, has <unk> and the water can go through it, so all the rain water will flow into the sides and they will have a road that is easy to drive, and they will not <unk> water anymore.
The noise also disappear.
Because it's very open, all the red noise -- so it's a very quiet road in it.
It also has <unk> of course, and the downside of this road is that you can <unk>
What is <unk> You see that on this road the stones of the surface go out there.
First stone, then one more and more and more, etc., and <unk> -- well, I'm not going to do that.  But you can harm your <unk> and you're not happy with that.
And finally, this can also lead to more and more damage.
Sometimes you can create bumps with that.
<unk> He's ready.
<unk> of course, you can turn into a problem, but we have a solution.
So here you can actually see how the damage appears in this material.
It's a asphalt asphalt as I said, so only has a small amount of <unk> between stones.
Because of the <unk> the light <unk> the <unk> this <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> <unk> and if they <unk> they will be <unk> and separate from the <unk>
So if you drive the road, you will get the <unk> and you saw it here.
To solve this problem, we think of <unk> materials.
If we can make this material <unk> then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is use the <unk> of steel, <unk> from that to clean up, and we can cut out the steel <unk> in very small pieces, and we can mix these little bits with the <unk>
So we have asphalt with little bits of wool <unk>
Then you need a machine, like that you see here, that you can use for <unk> a <unk> machine.
<unk> can heat, especially steel is very good at that.
So what you have to do is heat the steel, melt the <unk> the <unk> flow by these <unk> and the stones are <unk> back to the surface.
Today I used a <unk> <unk> because I can't bring the great <unk> machine here on the stage.
The microwave oven, is a similar system.
I put the sample, I'm going to take you now to see what happened.
This is the show that comes out now.
I said we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to heat the shows.
We tried a lot of samples out there and then the government, you actually saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's really interesting. We have to <unk>
So they gave us a piece of road, 400 meters of the <unk> highway, where we had to do a lane lane test this material.
So that was what we did there. You see where we were doing the test on the road, and then, of course, this road lasts several years without any harm. That's what we know about practice.
We took a lot of samples from this road and test them in the lab.
We did age aging -- we put the samples, we put a lot of burden on them, the <unk> then with our <unk> machine and the <unk> and we went back to a <unk>
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can say that we've made a material using steel fibers bringing together these fibers, using <unk> energy to actually increase the life of the surface of the road, even they can double the life of the surface.
And now, of course, they're kind of curious about this too.
We still have it here. It's pretty hot.
Actually, it has to cool cool before I can show you how the repair works.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yeah, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11, I remember having woken up one morning with the sound of the <unk> in my house.
My father was listening to BBC News in his little gray radius.
He had a great smile on his face that was unusual at those days, because the news is generally <unk>
The Taliban <unk> <unk> <unk>
I didn't know what to do, but I could see that my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a <unk> school told me.
One morning I will never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years old when the Taliban were <unk> from Afghanistan and made it illegal for girls to go to school.
For the next five years, I was <unk> as a child to <unk> my senior sister who could no longer be used outside, to go to a secret school.
It was the only way that the two could be <unk>
Every day, we were taking a road route so that no one would suspect where to <unk>
We had to hide the books in the market to seem like we were flying shopping.
The school was in a house, over 100 of us stuffed in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely <unk> in summer.
We all knew we were going to <unk> our lives, the teacher, students and our parents.
Occasionally in a while, the school lost suddenly for a week, because the Taliban <unk>
We always wondered what they knew of us.
They were <unk>
Did you know where you <unk>
We were <unk> but still, the school was where we wanted to be.
I was so lucky to grow in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters are <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
A total <unk> of a remote province of Afghanistan. <unk> in which his daughter, my mother, was to school and so his father was <unk>
But my raised mother became a teacher.
This is her.
It was left two years ago, just to turn our home home for girls and women from our neighborhood.
And my father, this is the first of his family in getting education.
There was no doubt that his children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the <unk> despite the risks.
For him, there was a higher risk in not to educate her children.
For the years of <unk> I remember that there were moments where I was very frustrated by our life and was always scared and I didn't see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father said, <unk> daughter -- you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money, you can tell them to leave your house for a war.
But there's one thing that always will be with you, what's here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we're going to do it.
So you still want to do not <unk>
I'm 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that's been destroyed for decades of war.
Less than six percent of women in my age have more than school, and if my family hadn't been so committed to my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find myself proud to graduate in <unk> College.
When I came back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was <unk> from his home for the courage to educate her daughters, was one of the first to <unk>
He wasn't just <unk> from my university degree, but also that I was the first woman, and I'm the first woman, who carry it on the streets of Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I dream big, but my family has even bigger dreams for <unk>
That's why I'm the global <unk> <unk> a global campaign to educate women.
This is why <unk> <unk> the first and perhaps the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country where it's still risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is that I see students in my school with the strong desire to take advantage of the opportunity.
And I see their parents and their families who, as my friends, <unk> for them, despite the face of an opposition <unk>
As <unk> It's not his real name, and I can't show you his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than a month ago, he and his daughter went on the way back to his village, and literally was <unk> from being killed by a bomb on the road, for minutes.
When you get home, they're the phone, a voice noticed that if he was still sending her daughter to school, they would go back to try.
<unk> already, if he said, "but it didn't hurt the future of my daughter for their old and <unk> ideas."
What I've realized in Afghanistan, and this is something that is often <unk> in the West, is that behind most of you who have a father who recognized the value of their daughter and to see that the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been key in our success.
In fact, they're often the first compelling <unk> of the brilliant future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under the <unk> the girls who were to school told <unk> remember, it was illegal.
But today, over three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan is so different from here in the U.S.
I find that Americans see the fragility of changes.
And I guess these changes would not last long after the retirement of American troops in the U.S.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I see students in my school and their parents who <unk> for them, I see a future <unk> future change and <unk>
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities for me, and every day, the girls of <unk> would tell me.
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
Never have forgotten the words of my grandmother's words who died in the <unk> <unk> resists him.
But you never get a revolutionary bit of revolutionary <unk>
They've spent almost two years since the <unk> revolution was inspired by the <unk> of mass <unk> so much of the <unk> revolution.
A forces with a lot of other citizens built inside and outside of the country to call a day of anger and starting a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And it was a big revolution.
Women and young men who are <unk> were in the middle, <unk> the fall of the regime, carrying <unk> of freedom, dignity and social justice.
You have shown a copy by the face of the brutal dictatorship of <unk>
They've shown a great sense of solidarity from the Middle East, to the West to the west, to the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of brutal war and some loss of loss of about 50,000 dead <unk> we have to release our country and remove the <unk>
However, <unk> left a heavy charge, a legacy of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the <unk> regime of <unk> destroyed infrastructure, the culture and the moral structure of the society.
<unk> from the devastation and the challenges, I have wanted, along with a lot of other women, to rebuild civil society, rebuild a sustainable transition and fair transition to democracy and national <unk>
There were approximately 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after the <unk> about 300 in <unk>
After a period of a period of <unk> years of exile, I went back to Libya and with a unique deal, I began to organize workshops about the capacities of capacities and leadership skills.
With an incredible group of women we founded the <unk> of Women Are <unk> by the <unk> a movement of women, political orientation, <unk> orientation, to advocate for the <unk> autonomy autonomy and our law of participation in the construction of democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the <unk> period, an environment that was increasingly <unk> that it was <unk> of the selfish policies of domination and <unk>
Over time, our initiative was approved and successful.
Women won an <unk> of National Congress.
However, gradually the exhilaration of elections and the revolution as a whole, were <unk> every day we found news news about violence.
One day we woke up with the news of the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Another day <unk> with the news of the murder of the American ambassador and the attack on <unk>
Another day we woke up with the news of the murder of the military officers in the army.
And every day, every day we woke up with the government of the <unk> and their <unk> human rights violations.
Our society, shaped by a <unk> mentality, and it has gone away from the ideals and the principles of freedom, dignity, dignity, social justice, that we had at the beginning.
<unk> and <unk> became the icons of the consequences of the revolution.
I'm not here today at all right now to <unk> our story of the success of the <unk> <unk> and the election.
Rather, I'm here today to tell us that we, as nation, we choose to take the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize?
Because the elections didn't brought peace and stability and security to Libya.
The <unk> list, and the <unk> between candidates and <unk> brought peace and reconciliation <unk>
No, they didn't.
What happened then?
Why our society is still <unk> and dominated with selfish policies of domination and <unk> as much as men like women?
Perhaps what was missing was not only women, but the female values of compassion, <unk> and <unk>
Our society needs the national dialogue and the creation of consensus more than the election needed the election, which is just polarization and <unk>
Our nation needs the <unk> representation of the feminine <unk> of the <unk> the <unk> representation of it.
We need to stop acting as agents of outrage, and call them out of anger.
We need to begin to act as agents of compassion and mercy.
We have to develop a female speech that not only <unk> but also put the mercy of <unk> instead of <unk> collaboration instead of competition, <unk> rather than <unk>
These are the ideals that a Libya, <unk> by war, desperately needs to be able to achieve peace.
Because peace has a <unk> which is about the interrelationship and <unk> between female perspectives and <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that in an existential way before we do it <unk>
According to a <unk> of the Koran <unk> <unk> "is the word of God <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the same time, the word <unk> which is known in all of the <unk> traditions and it has the same root in Arabic that the word <unk> <unk> the feminine and <unk> that spans all of the humanity that men and women are <unk>
And so, just like the uterus is full of the <unk> which grows inside, the divine matrix of compassion <unk> all the existence of existence.
This is how to tell us, "My mercy is <unk>
So you tell us, "My <unk> <unk> about my <unk>
That all of us are <unk> the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about a scary question that has an equally <unk> response.
It's about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to address is that everybody makes a regular <unk> Why is she left?
Why was somebody going to stay with a man who <unk>
I'm not a psychiatrist, or social worker, I didn't have an expert in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story to tell.
I was 22 years old. He had just <unk> at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York City for my first work as a writer and editor at <unk> magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first <unk> <unk> American <unk> and I had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, that I was creating my alma mater, me, <unk> my head with a <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk>
The man who I loved who I loved anyone in this world, put a gun on my head and <unk> with <unk> more times than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a psychological trap <unk> of love, where they fall every year millions of women, and even some men.
It could even be his story.
I don't look like a typical survivor of domestic violence.
I'm a <unk> in English at Harvard University, and I have an MBA in <unk> Business <unk>
I've spent most of my career working on the <unk> list of <unk> <unk> between them Johnson & Johnson, Leo <unk> and The Washington <unk>
I've been nearly 20 years married with my second husband and have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and drive a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can go to anyone, all races, all the races, all religions, every single income and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that they all think that domestic violence happens to women, which is a problem of women.
Not exactly.
Over 85 percent of the <unk> are men, and domestic abuse is only happening in <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> or, in the families, the last place in the families, the last place we would want or we would expect to find <unk> reason why, the domestic abuse is so <unk>
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world that would sit with a man who sticks with it, and I was actually a very typical victim because of my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States the women in between 16 and 24 years old, have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than the other ages, and over 500 women and girls are killed every year by partners, <unk> and <unk> husbands in the United States.
I also was a typical victim, because I didn't know anything about domestic violence, their warning signals or their patterns.
I met <unk> in a <unk> <unk> <unk>
I was sitting next to my side in the New York subway and started <unk> with me.
He told me two things.
The first one was that he had just <unk> from a university of <unk> <unk> and working on a very important bank of Wall Street.
But what struck me in that first encounter was that it was ready and fun, and that seemed like a <unk>
He had a few big <unk> as blocks, and a hair <unk> wheat, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the smartest things that made <unk> from the very beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of a mate.
He did it especially at the beginning, <unk> in a <unk>
We started getting out and loved everything that I was ready -- that I had gone to Harvard, I had been a passion to help girls, and my work.
I wanted to know everything about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a writer and as a woman, as a writer and as a woman, who had ever done it.
And it was why the <unk> of that <unk> school and the work on Wall Street and his brilliant future had so much relevance to it.
I didn't know that the first phase in any relationship of domestic violence is <unk> and <unk> the victim.
And I didn't know that the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was I went out of New York and leaving the work of my dreams, but I thought I had to do sacrifices for your partner, so I left my work and <unk> and I went together with Manhattan.
I had no idea that he was falling into a <unk> <unk> who was entering the head of a <unk> and financial trap and carefully carefully <unk>
The next step in the domestic of domestic violence is to introduce the threat to violence to see how it reacts it.
And this is where those <unk> come in.
As soon as we moved to New England you know, that place where I was supposed to <unk> I had to feel so safe to buy three <unk>
One was in the <unk> of the car.
Another <unk> underneath the pillow in our bed and the third always in his pocket.
And he said that he needed those guns to cause the trauma to live in a row.
I needed them to feel secure.
But those guns were actually a message for me, and even though I had never lost my hand, my life was already serious enough for every day.
The first physical attack of <unk> happened five days before our wedding.
It was seven o'clock in the morning, and I still had the <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises of my neck had disappeared, I put my mother's <unk> I was married with him.
Even though I had occurred, it was sure that we were happy living forever forever, because I loved her and I loved it.
And I was very, very <unk>
It just felt very <unk> for the wedding and actually to form a family with me.
I had been an isolated accident, and I would never make it harm.
I spent twice on our moon of honey.
The first time I was driving into a secret beach and I <unk> and he gave me so hard in the head that <unk> several times against the car <unk>
And then, a couple of days later, driving back from our <unk> of honey was <unk> by traffic and threw me a Big Mac <unk> to the face.
<unk> continued to <unk> one or twice a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage.
I <unk> when I thought it was the only thing in this situation.
One of three American women is victim of domestic violence or bullying at some point in their life, and the Centers for Disease Control reports that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million.
So, actually, I had very good company.
To go back to my question: Why do I get <unk>
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
Instead, I was a very strong woman in love with a deeply <unk> man, and it was the only person in the world who could help <unk> face <unk>
The other question that everyone does is, why don't you just get <unk>
Why didn't I get <unk> I could have gone at any time.
For me, this is the saddest and painful question that people do, because we have the victims, we know something that normally you <unk> is incredibly dangerous to abandon a <unk>
Because the last phase of domestic violence is <unk>
More than 70 percent of the murders of domestic violence happens after the victim has end up to the relationship, after <unk> because then the <unk> already has nothing to lose.
Other repercussions include permanent <unk> even after the <unk> has returned to marry, <unk> of financial resources, and translated the victim of the family judicial system to <unk> the victim and their children, who normally are forced by judges not to spend the man who <unk> their mother.
And yet we continue to ask why it's just not <unk>
I was able to go, because of one last <unk> up to beat my denial.
I realized that the man who loved so much, would have killed if it was allowed.
So I broke the silence.
He told everyone to the world: the police, my neighbors, my friends and family, to full strangers, and I am here today because all of you are <unk>
We have the tendency to <unk> victims like <unk> <unk> women -- <unk> goods.
The question, "Why are you <unk>
For some people this is a way to say <unk> is by <unk> as if the victims was <unk> <unk> <unk> of men who want to <unk>
But since I published <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who were also <unk> that they learned a <unk> lesson from what happened to them and to <unk> their lives joyful and happy lives and mothers, completely free of violence, like mine.
Because it turns out that I'm actually a victim and a survivor.
I was marrying with a <unk> man, and we have those three kids.
I have that black <unk> and also that <unk>
What I'm not going to do is, you would never, ever have -- it's a <unk> <unk> pointing at my head in your hands of somebody who says you want.
At this point, they're thinking, <unk> that's <unk> or <unk> what stupid <unk> but all this time I have actually been talking about you.
I assure you that there are a few people who are listening to me right now -- that they're being <unk> or that they were kind of <unk> they are <unk> themselves.
<unk> might be affecting their daughter, her sister, to his best friend right now.
I was able to end up to my crazy particular love breaking the silence.
And I keep doing it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last request to you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
<unk> abuse only in silence.
They have the power to end up with domestic violence simply shedding light on it.
We need the victims to all the world.
We need each one of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
<unk> the <unk> in the light talking about it with their kids, their coworkers and their friends and family.
<unk> their view of survivors like fantastic people, and <unk> who have a future <unk>
<unk> the early signs of violence for intervening consciously, to stop their climb and show the victims a safe way.
Together, we can turn our beds, our tables and our tables in the oasis and our families in the oasis and <unk> that should be.
Thank you.
Hello. My name is Cameron <unk> and for a while, I'm a model.
To be precise, for 10 years.
And I feel that at this point, there is a <unk> tension in the room because I shouldn't have dress this like this.  luckily, I brought her clothes to <unk>
This is the first shift in clothes on a <unk> stage, so you have a lot of kind of <unk> I think.
If some of the women are <unk> when they <unk> they don't have to <unk> right now, but I'll find it later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think about as just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These are very <unk> less than I don't have to use.
The worst part is to pass this sweater out of the head, because it's when they're laughing at me, so you don't do anything as I cover my head.
All right.
Why did I do this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope not as much as this picture.
The appearance is powerful, but also <unk>
I have completely changed what they thought about me in six seconds.
And in this picture, I had never had a boyfriend in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable and the photographer said to me that I would take her back and <unk> the hair.
Of course, except with surgery or an artificial <unk> like the one I did two days ago for work, there are very little that we can do to transform our way -- which, even though shallow and <unk> has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, to me, being brave means being honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model of a model.
Because I'm a nice, white woman, and in my workforce, that's a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but <unk>
The first question is, how do you get a role model?
And I always say, <unk> I discovered, but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I did model is because I won the genetic lottery. And I'm the <unk> of an <unk> and maybe you're wondering what's this <unk>
Well, over the last centuries we have not only defined beauty as health, youth and symmetry, which are biologically programmed to <unk> we also have associated with a high and <unk> shape, to <unk> and a white skin.
And that's my heritage for the heritage I've known to take to make money.
And I know that there are people in the audience who are now showing <unk> and maybe there are some <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Joan <unk> <unk> <unk>
First of all, the <unk> for knowing how many models.
But unfortunately, I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student at the University of New York told each and every one of the models in the <unk> and the <unk> models, just less than four percent, were not white percent.
The next question that people always ask me is: Can it be a model for <unk>
And my first answer is, I don't know, I don't know about that.
But then, what I would really tell you about every one of these girls is: Why? Can you be what you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a surgeon and <unk> <unk> and poet, which would be awesome, as you were the first.
If after this spectacular list, I still <unk> No, no, Cameron, I want to be a model, then I say, "I know my <unk>
Because I'm not in charge of anything, and you could be the <unk> <unk> of American <unk> or the <unk> executive director or the next Steven <unk>
To say that more you want to be model is like saying you want to win the lottery when you're larger.
It's out of your control, it's amazing, and it's not a job you can choose.
I'm going to show you everything I learned in 10 years as a model, because unlike <unk> surgery, can be summarized right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you've got your studies, you put your studies, and you have a curriculum on your back, no matter what you want, you know, if you <unk> you want to be President of the United States, but your label -- Model <unk> for 10 years, people will look like this.
The next question that people always do is if all the photos are <unk>
And yes, pretty much <unk> all the photos, but that's just a small part of what happens.
So this was the first picture I got in, and also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have my period.
I know we're entering the personal terrain.
So I was looking at my grandmother, a few months earlier.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am at a <unk> party a few days before the photos for French <unk>
Here I am with my football team and the <unk> magazine.
And this is me today.
And I hope you realize I'm not in those photos.
They're <unk> <unk> <unk> photographers and <unk> and all their <unk> and <unk> people and <unk> and they get to create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people always do is: <unk> things for free?
I have too many another six inches and I never use, except for the before, but the privileges I get that I get in real life, and that we don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and I once went to a store and I forgot to take money, and they gave me the <unk>
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> stepped into a red light and of course, <unk> and <unk> a sorry, agent in order to be able to keep <unk>
<unk> of these <unk> for me, not because of what I am. And there are people who are paying a price for their way no matter who they are.
I live in New York, and last year, of <unk> teenagers who were <unk> and 86 percent were black and <unk> and most of them were young men.
And there are only <unk> young black and Latino young men in New York, so for them, is not a question of <unk>
But how many times are I <unk>
When we looked at this talk, I learned that at 53 percent of the <unk> girls in the United States don't like their body, and that figure goes up to 78 percent to the 17.
So the last question that people do is: How is the life of a model?
And I think the answer that you expect is, if you're a little bit <unk> and you have the most bright hair, you'll feel very happy and beautiful.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe it <unk>
<unk> It's really wonderful to travel, and also incredible to be able to work with smart creative people.
And all of that is true, but it's just a part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, what I never said in front of the <unk> is: I'm insecure.
And I am because I have to worry about my way every day.
And if you ever ask yourself, get some more thin legs and the smartest hair will be happier?
They just have to meet with a group of models, because they have the <unk> legs -- the brighter hair and your clothes more to fashion -- but they're probably the most insecure women on the planet.
But mostly it was hard to analyze a situation of race and gender oppression when I'm one of the biggest <unk>
If there is something that I know about this talk, I hope that you all feel more comfortable than the power of the image in the perception that we have from success and failure.
Thank you.
Photography has been my passion ever since I was bigger enough to hold up a camera, but I want to share with you my 15 more pictures -- and I didn't get myself to them.
There was no directors, <unk> no opportunity to repeat the photos, not even a very low care <unk>
In fact, most of them were taken tourists at random.
My story begins when I <unk> in New York City to give a <unk> my wife brought me this picture holding my daughter on the day of his first birthday. That's the <unk> corner and <unk>
He happened to happen to New York just a year later, so we decided to take the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes right now.
When I was approaching the third birthday of my daughter, my wife said to me, why don't you take <unk> to New York on a <unk> journey, and you drive the <unk>
So here is when we started asking the tourists that they were going to take away the picture.
It's amazing that the gesture of delivering the camera to a complete unknown is so universal.
No one has been denied and, fortunately, no one has been <unk> with the camera.
So we weren't aware of how much life would change this journey.
It became something sacred to us.
This picture is a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day that day was a five year-old girl could understand.
These pictures are much more than representations of particular time or a specific time.
They're also a way to stop in a week in October and to make us think about our time and our evolution over the years, and not only at the physical level, but in all of the senses.
Because, even though we always get the same picture, our perspective changes, my daughter <unk> new <unk> and I can see life through his eyes and how you perceive and interact with everything.
That particular time in concrete we spend together is something that we hope with illusion all the year.
So recently, on one of the travel, we were walking, when all of a sudden it was stopped and pointed out a red <unk> of the <unk> shop that was <unk> in previous <unk>
And he described to me what had felt about five years on the same place.
<unk> that remembered their heart <unk> with force to see that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what he looks at in New York is universities, because it's determined to study in New York.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things we create are the memories.
So I want to share the idea of actively participating in the conscious <unk>
I don't know about you, but besides these 15 pictures, I don't go out in many of the family photos.
I'm always the one who takes the picture.
Today I want to encourage you all to come up in the picture, and I don't want to go and zoom in to someone and ask him about this picture?
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
<unk> are in the most <unk> group.
First of all, why do you have so bad <unk>
It's also associated with Disney laughter -- as a silly figure, <unk>
More recently, if you've been following the press and laughter, and applause and <unk> these are the attributes that associate with Parliament <unk> but I don't accept it.
I don't accept it. You know why?
Because the members of Parliament are not clean down the environment.  <unk> don't help prevent the spread of disease.
<unk> are <unk>   They're far from <unk>  And my favorite, the <unk> have better presence.
There are the <unk> in the New World -- which are mostly in the <unk> like the <unk> and the <unk> and the World <unk> World <unk> where we have 16 species from these 16, 11 faced a high risk of extinction.
So why do we <unk> are important, first of all, provide vital ecological services, <unk>
They're our <unk> natural garbage <unk>
They <unk> people to bone.
They help kill all the bacteria. They help absorb the anthrax that is not going to be <unk> and causing huge amounts of livestock and diseases in other animals.
Recent recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no <unk> our bodies take three to four times longer in <unk> and this has huge ramifications in the spread of disease.
<unk> also have a huge historical importance.
They've been associated with ancient culture.
<unk> was the symbol of protective and maternity and, along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between the <unk> and under <unk> Egypt.
<unk> <unk> <unk> was the god <unk> and risked his life to save the <unk> god.
In <unk> culture, they are very important to open open <unk> In places like <unk> there's nowhere to bury the dead or wood to <unk> so these <unk> provide a natural elimination system.
What is the problem with <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, which six are at extreme <unk>
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason they're being <unk> is because there are conflicts between humans and <unk> <unk> communities use this venom against predators, and as a consequence, the <unk> are victims of this.
In southern Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are on the critically endangered list, which means that in less than 10 or 15 years <unk> and the reason is because they fall prey to the livestock consumption that has been treated with a drug <unk> like <unk>
This drug has been banned for veterinary use in India and have taken a posture.
Because there are no <unk> there's been a spread in the number of dogs <unk> in <unk> and when you have dogs dogs -- you have a huge amount of time <unk> for <unk> The number of cases of rage has increased in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the biggest wind farms in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be above Lake <unk>
I'm not against wind energy, but we have to work with governments, because wind turbines do this to birds. They cut them in half.
They're <unk> of birds.
In West Africa, there is a horrible trade trade, dead to serve the <unk> and the <unk> market.
So what are you doing? Well, we're researching these birds. We're <unk> <unk>
We're trying to determine their basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that they travel through different countries, so you can focus on a local problem, it's not going to be at all.
We have to work with governments at the <unk> level.
We're working with local communities.
We're talking to them about appreciating the <unk> about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and services that we <unk>
How can you help? It can become assets, making noise. You can write a letter to your government and tell you, we need to focus on these very <unk> creatures.
When you go out of this room, they will inform them about the <unk> but they talk to their families, with your children, with your neighbors on the <unk>
These are very <unk> Charles Darwin said that it changed from opinion because he saw them flying without effort, without energy spending on the heavens.
Kenya, this world, will be much more poor without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every thing I do and everything I do <unk> my life has been <unk> by seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
From <unk> to <unk> <unk> young, but I'm no longer am.  I worked in Zambia, Kenya, Costa <unk> <unk> and Somalia.
I worked for a <unk> NGO and every project that we set up in sub-Saharan Africa.
And I was <unk>
We were going to go to the 21, that Italians were good people, and we were doing good work in Africa.
Instead of that, everything that <unk> <unk>
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> of the <unk> was a project where a few Italians decided to teach the people of country to grow food.
So we got to seed seeds to the south of Zambia.
And of course, people were not at all interested in doing that, so they would tell them to come to work, and sometimes they didn't know --  We were sure that the local people, in that valley, not had agriculture.
But instead of asking you how it was possible that we would not say anything, we just said, "Thank God we are here --  <unk> at time to save the people of <unk>
And of course, everything in Africa was grown <unk>
We got these magnificent <unk> in Italy, a tomato would grow to this size. In Zambia, to this size.
And we couldn't believe it, we were telling the <unk> "Look how easy it is <unk>
When the tomatoes were beautiful, <unk> and red at night at the morning, about 200 <unk> appeared from the river and ate everything.  And we said, "Oh my God, the <unk>
And the <unk> said, "Yeah, that's why we don't have agriculture here --  "Why don't you get it, you're never <unk>
I thought we just have the Italians <unk> errors in Africa, but then I saw what Americans were doing -- what the English people were doing and then to see what they were doing, I felt quite proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, as you can see, at least we feed <unk>
<unk> see the <unk> --  <unk> look at the waste that we gave them to the <unk> people of Africa.
She wants to read a book, read <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, the Western donor countries, we've delivered the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
Don't tell you about the damage that that money has <unk>
Just read your book.
<unk> from an African woman, the damage we've done.
The Westerners are <unk> <unk> <unk> and we treat people only two things: or the <unk> or we're <unk>
The two words come from the Latin <unk> which means <unk>
However, they mean two different things.
<unk> I deal with any of a different culture as if they were to be my kids, I want you a lot."
<unk> I deal with all of the different culture as if they were <unk>
That's why white people are called <unk>
That book gave me a slap in the face. The small thing is <unk> written by <unk> who said for all economic development, if people don't want to be <unk> <unk> alone.
This should be the first principle of aid.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the gentleman that opened this conference put a cane stick on the floor and said, we can -- you know, you can imagine a city that is not <unk>
I decided for 27 years only to respond to people, and I invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never start anything, you have never motivates anyone, but it becomes a <unk> of the local passion, the <unk> of the local passion, who have the dream to become a better person.
So what do you do? They <unk>
It never comes to a community with an idea, and they sit with people in the <unk>
We don't work from offices.
We met in a cafe. We met in a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we found out what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give an idea to somebody.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what is it going to do you?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that man has for its own personal growth is the most important thing.
And so we helped them find knowledge because nobody in the world can succeed alone.
The person with the idea may not have knowledge -- but knowledge is available.
So years and years ago, I had this idea: Why not us, once instead of getting to a community to tell people what to do, why not, for once, for once, I would love them, but not in community meetings.
I'll tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community meetings.
The entrepreneurs never <unk> and they will never say, in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what a chance have <unk>
So the planning has this blind point.
To the smartest people in their community, you don't even know it because they don't leave their public meetings.
What do we do? We work with one, and we work face to face -- you have to create a social infrastructure -- which doesn't exist.
You should create a new career.
The profession is the family doctor from the company, the family doctor in the business -- who is established with you in their house, on the table of his kitchen table in coffee and help find the resources to transform their passion in a way of a living.
I started this as a test in <unk> city in Western Australia.
I was doing a Ph.D. in that time, trying to get away from this condescending garbage where we came to tell them what to do.
In a year, I had 27 projects going on, and the government came to me to see how you can do that?
How can I do <unk> I said, "I did something very, very difficult.
I <unk> and <unk>  So the government says, <unk> <unk>  We've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We have helped start 40,000 businesses.
There's a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of <unk>
Peter <unk> one of the greatest business <unk> of the story, passed away to '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a philosophy of philosophy before involved in business, and this is what Peter <unk> says, "The planning is actually incompatible with a society and an economy of <unk>
The planning is the kiss of the death of the corporate spirit.
So now <unk> <unk> <unk> not knowing what the most <unk> people in <unk> want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to come around with you.
You have to offer you for <unk> privacy, has to be fantastic to the <unk> and then <unk> are in mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we got 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people and the intelligence and <unk>
Which is what you've got to do is this tomorrow?
<unk> <unk> That's what you have <unk>
So what I tell you is that the entrepreneurial spirit is where it is.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution <unk> fossil revolution is not renewable <unk> and at one point we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way of holding <unk> is not sustainable.
What we have to consider, is how we <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to seven billion people, in a sustainable form.
There are no technologies to do it.
Who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution, <unk> <unk>
The government?
They will be entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There's a lovely story that I read in a <unk> magazine many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York City in the <unk>
And in the year, I got together and gathered this group of people, and I <unk> what would happen to New York City in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> New York City would not have within 100 years.
Why? Because they analyzed the curve and <unk> if the population keeps growing up to this <unk> to move the population of New York to the <unk> <unk> six million horses, and the manure produced by six million horses that would be impossible to <unk>
They were already <unk> in <unk>  So, in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty little technology that <unk> life in New York.
So what happens? Over the next 40 years, in 1900, in the United States showed up, <unk> companies <unk> <unk>
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there was very few years -- <unk> factories in <unk> places.
<unk> Michigan.
However, there is a secret to work with the entrepreneurs.
First, you have to offer them <unk>
Otherwise, they're not going to talk with you.
Then you have to offer an absolute <unk> <unk> service.
And then you will have to tell you the truth about <unk>
The smallest company, the biggest company, it has to be able to do three things: the product that you want to sell has to be fantastic, you have to count with a fantastic marketing and you have to count on a great financial administration.
Do you know what?
We have never met a single human being in the world that can be able to sell and look for money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This is still not born.
We have tested and looked at the 100 companies, <unk> <unk> <unk> all the new companies, Google, <unk>
There's only one thing that all of the successful companies in the world have in common, only one: no one was started by one person.
It would never be the word <unk> but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when he started.
Nobody begins a company alone.
So we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a small business set of small businesses in <unk> along with their dedicated comrades in bars with their dedicated comrades who will do for you, what someone did for you, who is somebody who talks about this <unk> someone who will ask you, what would you need?
What can you? Can you do it?
Well, you can <unk> it can look for the <unk>
"Oh no, I can't do that." <unk> he looks at <unk>
We activate communities.
Thank you.
The people around us can help us in many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we didn't swap a lot of knowledge in spite of sharing the same public spaces.
Over the last few years, I've tried to share more with my neighbors in public space, with simple tools like <unk> and <unk> and chalk.
These projects came out of questions like, how much pay my neighbors for their <unk>
How can we pay and borrow more things without calling the door at a bad moment?
How do we share more memories of our abandoned buildings, and better understand our <unk>
How do we share more of our hopes for cows for our communities to reflect our needs and <unk>
I live in New <unk> and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds a relief with the giant <unk> that give shadow to <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries and I trust a city.
It always <unk> the music --  -- there's a classroom in New York   The city has one of the most beautiful architectures in the world, but also one with the highest abandoned share of the U.S.
I live near this house and I thought how it could turn it into a more nice space for the neighborhood and also something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone who loved who a lot.
It was <unk> like a mother for <unk>
His death was sudden and unexpected.
I thought a lot about death and <unk>
And this made me a profound gratitude for life and lived and this produced a profound gratitude for the time.
He told the significant things of my current life.
But I would try to keep this look in my daily lives.
It seems to me it's easy to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get sucked into the day and forget the really important for one.
So with the help of old and new friends transformed the wall of this house left on a giant board and painted over her phrases to <unk> "Before they die <unk>
So the <unk> could take a <unk> reflect on their lives and sharing personal aspirations in public space.
I didn't know what to wait for this experiment, but the next day the wall was filled and kept <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
Before they died, I want to be trial on trial for <unk>  "Before I die I want to sit down at the line of <unk> change.
Before they die of dying, I want to sing for millions of people.
Before they die, I want to plant a <unk>
Before they died, I want to live outside the <unk>
Before they die of dying, I want to catch you once more."
Before they die, I want to go to the rescue <unk>
Before they die, I want to be completely myself."
This outer space became <unk> and the dreams and the hopes of people made me laugh at me, <unk> <unk> and gave me comfort at hard times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in new ways and <unk> it's about <unk> <unk> and <unk> and remembering what is most important for us as we grow and <unk>
This happened last year and started getting hundreds of messages from passionate people who wanted to do a wall in their community.
So with my colleagues at the civic center, we did a kit kit and now they've been done walls in countries around the world, like South Africa, Australia, Argentina and beyond.
Together, we demonstrated the power of our public spaces if they give us the opportunity to express ourselves and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have is time and our relationships with other people.
In our age of distractions on the rise. It is more important than ever, to find the ways of preserving the perspective and remember that life is short and fragile.
death is something that we often avoid talking about, or even think, but I understood that we prepared for death is one of those things that we would have more power.
And if you think about death in the <unk> our life.
Our shared spaces, can reflect better than we care as individuals and as a community and more media to share genuine fears and stories, the people around us cannot only help improve places, can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Today, I have a single request.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my brothers.
<unk> is 22 and very <unk>
<unk> but transmits joy better than some of the best speakers.
<unk> knows what love.
It is shared. <unk> happens what happens.
It's not <unk> You don't look at the color of the skin.
It doesn't matter to religious differences and look at this: it's never <unk>
When I singing our childhood, trying to <unk> words that I can't even <unk> it reminds me of one thing: the little thing we know about the mind and the wonderful thing that has to be the unknown.
Samuel has 16 years old. It's very hot.
<unk> the most <unk> memory.
However, it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember if I stole my <unk> but it reminds me of the year that every one of the songs came out of my iPod, conversation that we had when I was four years old in my arm during the first episode of the <unk> and the Lady birthday <unk>
<unk>
But most people don't.
And in fact, because their minds don't fit into the concept of normal society, they're often <unk> and <unk>
But what propelled my heart to my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, even though it didn't consider it inside <unk> that could only mean one thing: that were <unk> <unk> and extraordinary.
Now, for those less familiar with the term <unk> it's a complex brain disorder that affects social communication, learning and sometimes physical skills.
In each individual it manifests itself in a different way, that <unk> is so different to Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes will be diagnosed with a new case of autism, and even though it's one of the disorders of development that faster in the world, is no cause or cure <unk>
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without it.
I had only three years when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited to have a new self in my life.
When they spent a few months, I realized that he was different.
<unk> a lot.
I didn't want to play the other babies, and in fact, it didn't seem very interested in me at all.
He lived and <unk> in his own world, with their own rules, and I found pleasure in the smaller things, like putting the cars in a row around the room, looking at the washing machine and eat anything that was among <unk>
As I was growing up, it became more different, the differences became more evident.
But beyond <unk> the frustration and frustration and <unk> <unk> there was something really <unk> a pure nature, a little boy who saw the world without <unk> a human being that had never been <unk>
<unk>
I can't deny that there have been some difficult moments in my family, when I wish I wish they were just like me.
But I look back at the things that have taught me about individuality, communication and love, and I realize that they are things that I would not want to change the normal.
<unk> happens by the beauty that gives us the differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean that any is wrong.
It just means there's a different view of what's right.
If I could <unk> one thing to <unk> and Sam and you would be that you don't have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences you <unk> It's a <unk> Every one of us has a gift inside their interior and, honestly, the pursuit of <unk> is the last benefit of the potential.
The opportunity for <unk> progress and change is in the time when we try to be like others.
Please, don't tell me that I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit that must have been <unk> in the country of <unk>
Penn State asked me a communications teacher, to give up a kind of communication to engineering students.
I was scared.  <unk> really <unk> from these students with their great minds and their great books and their large words of words.
But because of these conversations, I felt what <unk> must have felt like when he fell down the <unk> hole and saw the door of a new world.
I felt that I was when I had those conversations with the students, I was surprised by the ideas that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to open that door is a great communication.
We desperately need a great communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones that are attacking our biggest challenges from energy to the environment and health care, each other, and if we don't know about this, the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as not scientists to have these interactions.
But these great conversations can't happen if our scientists and engineers are not invited to see their wonderful world.
And so scientists and engineers, please, <unk> with <unk>
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure that their science is sexy and that its engineering is attractive.
First question for <unk> and then what?
<unk> why science is relevant to us.
Don't tell us just studying the <unk> but they study the <unk> that are the mesh structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat <unk>
And when you're describing your science, caring for <unk>
<unk> is a obstacle to our understanding of his ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why not say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> accessible is not the same thing that make them dumb ones.
Instead, as Einstein, said everything is as easy as possible, but not simple.
They can also communicate their science without engaging the ideas.
Something to consider is to use examples, stories and analogies. These are ways of <unk> and <unk> with their content.
And by presenting their job -- forget about the signs of <unk>
Have you ever wondered why they're called <unk>  What do they do <unk> <unk> kill them and get their presentation.
A <unk> like this is not only boring, but it's being supported by the area of our brain and <unk> us.
Instead, this <unk> of <unk> Brown is much more effective, it shows that the special structure of the <unk> is so strong that it really inspired the unique design of the <unk> Tower, <unk>
The trick here is to use a simple quote -- <unk> that the audience can understand if you lose a bit, and then provide graphs that <unk> our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding of what they <unk>
I think these are just some key ones, that you can help others open the door and look at the country of the wonders that science and engineering.
And so scientists and engineers, when you've solved this equation, by all the media, <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words from all the Oxford English <unk> is <unk>
Just because it sounds pretty good.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Although there was an editor of the 19th century that was defined as much better when he said, "A <unk> is the one who looks for a public charge no matter where they are <unk> platform or principle, and that when he wins, he gets it by the mere use of a monumental <unk>
I have no idea what it means <unk>
Something to do with words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis in politics, and that all politicians know they have to try to dominate the language.
It was not <unk> for example, that the British Parliament allowed the newspapers to quote the exact words they were told in the <unk> camera.
And all of this was thanks to the courage of a guy with the <unk> <unk> who faced the <unk>
They put her in the London Tower and <unk> but he had enough courage to deal with them, and eventually had such popular support in London that I won.
And only a few years later, we had the first use of recorded by the phrase <unk> <unk> so <unk> <unk> like <unk>
Most people think it's <unk>
It's not. It's by a advocate of freedom of expression.
But to show you really how words and politics interact, I want you to go back to America, just after independence.
So they had to address the question of how to call George Washington leader.
They didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a country <unk>
This was <unk> in Congress for a long time.
They were introduced all kinds of suggestions that you might have <unk>
Some people wanted to call it the <unk> of <unk> and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> from the <unk> from the U.S. <unk>
Not very <unk>
Some people just wanted to call it <unk>
They thought it was <unk>
And they didn't even have that were <unk> they had the idea that you could be picked King by a fixed car.
And I could have <unk>
All the world got tired <unk> because this debate was <unk> for three weeks.
I read a poor <unk> and always <unk> <unk> with this <unk>
What caused the <unk> and the <unk> was that the House of Representatives were against <unk>
The House of Representatives didn't want that Washington to be <unk>
They didn't want to call it King for him or his designated ideas.
So they wanted to give the title more <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
And that title was <unk>
President. I didn't invent the title. It was already before, but it just meant <unk> that <unk> a <unk>
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have much more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There was <unk> presidents of small <unk> <unk> and <unk> of government, but it was really a <unk> degree.
And so the Senate is <unk>
They said, "Well ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to sign treated and meet with <unk> <unk>
"And who will take a really serious title with a <unk> <unk> <unk>
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate is not <unk>
We can learn three interesting things about this.
First of all, and this is my favorite one to where I've been able to figure out, the Senate has never been <unk> for President.
The President Barack Obama is lucky to continue there, waiting for the Senate to action.
The second thing we can learn is that when a government says that a measure is <unk>  <unk> possible that we are going to go ahead and get more years old.
But the third thing we can learn, and this is the most important thing, and with this -- I want to tell you that the President of the U.S. does not sound like modest today, right?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear <unk> nuclear <unk> the largest economy of the world and a fleet of air vehicles and so on.
Reality and history have endowed the <unk>
So I won the <unk>
They got their title from <unk>
And also the other concern of the Senate, the appearance of <unk> -- well, it was a <unk> so then.
But you know how many nations have now <unk>
And all because they want to sound like the <unk> of the 5,000 nuclear heads and so on.
So, at the end of the Senate I won and the House of <unk> because no one is going to feel humble when you tell them that now they're the President of <unk>
And I think that's the great lesson that we can learn, and that I would like to <unk>
The politicians are trying to choose and use words to shape and control reality, but actually changes changes a lot more words than what they could change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 to <unk> in a <unk> mine in Ghana.
The air is <unk> heat and dust and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of <unk> bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices that speak but above all, that cacophony of <unk> male and stones and stones with primitive tools.
Like the other people, I carry a <unk> cheap light of light in the head with this <unk> <unk> and I can barely distinguish the <unk> branches that hold the walls of that <unk> hole that drops hundreds of feet on the ground.
I <unk> my hand, and I suddenly remember a <unk> that I met days before, who lost the control and dropped <unk> meters on that <unk>
As I talk to you today, these men are in the deep way of that hole at that hole, and their lives don't pay and reward and, often, dying.
I went home and went home but they may never do it because they're prey to slavery.
In the last 28 years, I was documenting native cultures in over 70 countries in six continents, and in 2009, I had the great honor of being the only <unk> at the G8 <unk>
Among all the amazing people that I met there I met an <unk> of <unk> the <unk> an NGO that is dedicated to eradicate modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and really, I started learning about slavery because I knew there exist in the world, but not in the grade.
When we ended up talking to me that I was very sad, I honestly was getting rid of this <unk> of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
He made my stomach <unk> and weeks later, I flew to Los Angeles to meet the director of <unk> the <unk> and offer my help.
So my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I had been in many of these places.
And some of them, even considered my second home.
But this time, <unk> dirty <unk>
A conservative calculation says that there are over 27 million people <unk> in the world.
It's twice as much as the <unk> of Africans displaced throughout the <unk>
150 years ago, the cost of a slave slave was about three times the annual salary of a U.S. worker.
The equivalent of about 50,000 dollars.
However, today, you can enslave entire families by generations of <unk> debt above <unk>
Amazingly, slavery makes profits from over 13 billion dollars a year around the world.
Many have been <unk> with false promises of good education and better work to figure out they're forced to work without pay, under threat of violence and cannot escape.
Today slavery operates in the <unk> goods produced by slaves have value, but those who produce them are disposable them.
<unk> exists in most of the world and yet it's illegal to all over the world.
In India and Nepal, I met the brick <unk>
This strange and <unk> show was like entering the old Egypt or <unk>
<unk> in a temperature of 54 C, men, women, children, in fact, <unk> entire families -- <unk> <unk> <unk> bricks in their heads, until 18 at the time, and they take them from <unk> to trucks that are at hundreds of feet.
<unk> for <unk> and <unk> work in silence, doing this task again and again for 16 or 17 hours a day.
There was no <unk> to eat, or to drink, and the severe <unk> made it just a lot of <unk>
So <unk> were the heat and the dust that my camera became too hot to touch and stopped working.
Every 20 minutes I had to run into the car to clean up the team and make it work with air conditioning for <unk> and sitting there, like, my camera gets a much better treatment than these people.
Back in <unk> I wanted to cry but the <unk> who was on my side quickly grabbed me and said, <unk> don't do it. Don't do it here."
And it explained very clearly that I will demonstrate emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just for me but for them.
I couldn't offer any direct aid.
I couldn't give them money, nothing.
I was not <unk>
I could put them in a situation worse than they were already gone.
I had to rely on <unk> the <unk> and work within the system for his release and trusted that he <unk>
As soon as I waited to get home to feel my heart <unk>
In the Himalayas I found kids <unk> for miles on <unk> land to the trucks that were waiting down.
Those big <unk> were more heavy than the children who load them out and children <unk> their heads with leg <unk> made from <unk> ropes and <unk>
It's hard to witness something so <unk>
How can we influence something so <unk> but so <unk>
Some people don't even know they're slaves -- and they work 16 -- 17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been so much life.
They have nothing to <unk>
When these villagers <unk> his freedom, the <unk> had completely entirely their houses.
When you hear the word <unk> we often think of sexual traffic and because of this global consciousness, I thought it would be hard for me to work with security in this particular business.
In <unk> I was <unk> women who had been previously <unk> sex.
It took me through the stairs <unk> that gave this dirty <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was a restaurant.
<unk> as you know in the craft, they are local.
They have small rooms -- private rooms, where the <unk> <unk> with their girls and children, some of them only seven years -- they're forced and <unk> to buy more food and alcohol.
Each place is dark and <unk> identified by a number painted on the wall and divided by a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer sexual abuse in their clients.
On the <unk> I remember <unk> <unk> <unk> and, at that moment, I could barely imagine what should be caught in that hell.
I just had a little bit of a <unk> the stairs <unk>
There was no <unk>
There were no windows enough to <unk>
Those people don't have <unk> and, because we touch a very difficult issue, it's important to point out that slavery even sexual <unk> is happening around us.
There are hundreds of people in agriculture, in <unk> in the domestic service, and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 children are sold every year as a sex <unk>
It's everywhere, but we don't see it.
<unk> are another activity that often relate to labor <unk>
I visited Indian villages where there were entire families involved in the silk trade.
This is a family gap.
<unk> <unk> are the father, the <unk> of blue and the red, of the young kids.
<unk> <unk> in these big barrels and <unk> silk in the liquid to <unk> but <unk> is <unk>
My <unk> told me about his stories.
"We don't have <unk> they said.
We still hope, though, being able to get out of this house someday and go to another place where we actually pay our job."
It's estimated that there are more than 4,000 children <unk> in Lake <unk> the largest artificial lake in the world.
When we arrived, I went to take a quick look.
I saw what seemed to be a <unk> family on a boat, two older brothers, some younger brothers, some young kids -- it makes sense, right?
<unk> were all slaves.
Children are separated from their families and <unk> and forced to work <unk> in these boats on the lake, despite not knowing to swim.
This boy is eight years old.
When our boat came up to me was <unk> that his little canoe was <unk>
I was paralyzed by the fear of <unk>
The branches of the trees <unk> in Lake <unk> they often catch networks and children, <unk> and fear, <unk> water to unlock the branches.
Many of them are <unk>
Since <unk> has always been forced to work on the lake.
For fear of his love, it's not going to flee and like all life has been treated with cruelty, <unk> it tries to the younger slaves under their command.
I met these guys at five in the morning, when they were <unk> the last networks, but they had been working from the one one of the <unk>
At night he was cold and <unk>
And it would think that these networks weigh over 400 pounds when they're filled with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued in a village of fishermen.
I met him in a refuge where the <unk> <unk> victims of slavery.
Kofi symbolizes as possible.
Who will become because someone decided to make the difference in your life?
<unk> for a road in Ghana with <unk> partners the <unk> a fellow <unk> with his bike.
He asked us to take it on a way of land to the jungle.
At the end of the road, we were invited to get out of the car, and he asked the driver to go out quickly.
And then he pointed out this path just visible and said, "This is the way, this is the way.
As we began to go down, we took the <unk> that <unk> the path and after walking close to an hour -- we found that the path was <unk> by the recent <unk> so I put the photos of photos on my head as I put my head up to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> path ended up <unk> in one of us, and we had a mass of holes that I could fit in a soccer field, and they were all full of migrant workers.
Many women had children strapped on their backs and as they were looking for gold, <unk> in <unk> <unk>
The <unk> is used in the process of <unk>
These miners are <unk> in a well in another part of Ghana.
When they were out of the pump they were <unk> in their own <unk>
I remember I looked at his eyes tired, <unk> because many had been under land for 72 hours.
The wells, they have to be 90 feet and these people carry heavy stone bags and then they'll be transported to another area where the stone can get the gold in.
First of all, the site seems to be filled with strong men and <unk> but if you look closer, we see the next few other fortunate, and also children.
They're all victims of injury and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> will end up as this victim of T.B. and from <unk> <unk> in a few years.
This is <unk> When his father died he took him to work with him in the mines.
When his uncle, <unk> <unk> on the debt of the uncle who force him to be slave in the mines.
When I met her, I had worked in the mines 14 years and the injury of the leg that you see here is a product of an accident in the <unk> so serious that the doctors were supposed to be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has T.B. and nevertheless, it's forced to work night and day in that mine.
And yet, he has dreams with being liberated and educated with local activists like <unk> the <unk> and this is this kind of determination, in the face of a remote possibility that I'm a lot of respect.
I want to shine a light on slavery.
Did you know that your images would be seen for you all over the world.
I wanted you to know that we're going to provide witness to them, and we're going to do everything possible to help change their lives.
I really believe that if we can see each other as human beings, then it becomes very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery.
These images are not <unk> people -- but real people, like you, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There is no day that I'm going to think about these so many beautiful people, <unk> that I've had the great honor to know.
I hope that these images show a force in which you see, in people like you, and I hope that that force turns into a fire and that fire <unk> light on slavery because without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I do math math -- and there's a particular problem for the <unk> we are like management <unk>
Nobody knows what the hell we do.
So I'm going to try to explain to you what I do.
<unk> is one of the most human activities.
We <unk> the <unk> of the ballet <unk> and the dancers of <unk> --  that we'll see later on.
But <unk> demand a degree of extraordinary training. A high level of dexterity and probably certain <unk> <unk> that can well have a genetic component of it.
Sadly, the neurological disorders like Parkinson's disease, destroy this extraordinary ability to do with my friend <unk> <unk> who, in his time, was a <unk> a ballet dancer ballet dancer <unk>
Over the last few years, it has been moved in the treatment.
However, there are <unk> millions of people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with a <unk> <unk> <unk> and other symptoms of this disease, so we need tools to be able to detect the disease before it is too late.
We need to be able to measure progress in an objective way, and ultimately, the only way we're going to know if there is really a cure to be when we have an objective metric to have an objective measure and <unk>
But it's frustrating for Parkinson's and other disorders of the movement with no biological markers -- so they don't make the blood analysis and the best we have is a <unk> <unk>
You have to go to a clinic to do that. It's very, very expensive, and that means that, out of clinical trials, they never do.
And what if patients could do it at home?
That would save a <unk> trip to the clinic. What if the patients could do the test <unk>
It wouldn't take personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the <unk> clinic.
So what I want to tell you is as a conventional form of a try, you see, in a certain sense, at least, we are all <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of the vibration of string <unk>
It shows someone healthy as it makes sounds of the talk, we can imagine how we can imagine how the dancers of a vocal ballet ballet ballet ballet firefly because we have to coordinate all those vocal organs to produce sounds and we all have the genes for example.
And as they did, it requires an extraordinary level of training.
Let's think about time that leads to a child learning to speak.
From the sound, we can track the position of vocal cords as <unk> and like Parkinson's disease, it affects <unk> it also affects <unk> organs.
On the bottom plot you can see a <unk> example of the elastic <unk>
We see the same <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
The speech becomes more quiet and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do you compare these tests based on the voice with the <unk> clinical trials -- well, they're both not <unk>
The neurological test isn't <unk> They both use existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to do them.
They're both <unk> OK, but <unk> tests are not <unk>
I mean, they can be <unk>
They are very quickly, take about 30 seconds as a lot.
They're <unk> and we all know what happens is happening.
When something takes such a <unk> cost.
These are some incredible goals to <unk>
We can reduce the <unk> difficulties of patients.
I would not need to go to the clinic for follow-up <unk>
<unk> frequently we could get objective data.
We could do mass <unk> for clinical trials for clinical trials and for the first time, <unk> <unk> at scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking at the first <unk> of the disease before it is too late.
So by giving you the first steps in that sense, we are launching the Parkinsons Initiative <unk>
Together with <unk> and <unk> we want to register a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start to address these goals.
We have local <unk> accessible to 750 million people in the world.
<unk> with no disease, it can call low price and leave recordings for a few cents. And I'm pleased to announce that we've already reached six percent goal in just eight hours.
Thank you.  Tom Rielly: So <unk> taking all of these samples of, let's say 10,000 people -- you'll be able to say who's healthy and who doesn't?
What will you get from these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yeah. What happens is that during the call you have to indicate if you have or not the disease. Sure.
<unk> You see, some people may not <unk> You may not get it.
But we're going to get a very large sample of data in different circumstances, and do it in different circumstances is important because we're looking at the factors of confusion by the real markers of disease.
TR: You have a <unk> accuracy right now.
<unk> much more than that.
Actually, my student <unk> I have to <unk> has done fantastic work, and now it has shown that it works on the mobile phone network, well, what we <unk> the project. We now have 99 percent accuracy.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's <unk>
<unk> Absolutely.
TR: Thank you so much. Max <unk> public.
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March 2011, I made <unk> <unk> in New York City.
We are <unk> creatures.
We <unk> in the dark, in rooms without windows and generally we avoid sunlight.
We make the thin models even more <unk> the perfect skin still more <unk> we do the impossible, possible and <unk> in the press all the time, but some of us are really artists with talent with a lot of years of experience and a real taste for images and photography.
On March 11, 2011, I saw from my house, just like the rest of the world, the <unk> events that were happening in Japan.
Shortly after later, an organization where I was <unk> there was a <unk> where <unk> was in the place working as part of the answer.
I, with hundreds of other volunteers we knew we couldn't stay in home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
On May 13 of May I traveled to <unk>
It's a little <unk> village in the <unk> <unk> of almost 50,000 people, one of the first towns affected by the wave.
The level of water recorded over 24 feet tall and over three miles land inside.
As you can imagine, the village was <unk>
<unk> rubble from channels and <unk>
<unk> <unk> We removed the slime <unk> and we leave the houses to be <unk> and <unk>
We took tons of tons and tons of dead fish, <unk> <unk> from the local factory.
We <unk> and we loved it.
For weeks, both volunteers like the neighbors found similar things.
They found pictures and <unk> photos and cameras and chambers of <unk>
Everybody did the same thing.
We <unk> and bring them to different places of the villages of around to <unk>
It wasn't until I realized that these pictures represented a huge part of the personal losses that people had <unk>
As they were fleeing the wave, and to save their lives, they had to leave everything they had.
At the end of my first week, I started to help in a <unk> center of the people.
It helped to clean up the toilets, gigantic enormous, giant <unk>
This place turned out to be also the place of the village where the center of <unk> <unk> the photos.
There was the honor and I had the honor that that day <unk> in me to clean up the photos.
This was exciting and inspiring, had heard the expression beyond the <unk> but it wasn't until beyond myself my horizons that something happened.
When you look at the photos, I found some of them who had more than a hundred years old, some of them were still in the lab, I couldn't stop thinking about how to fix that <unk> and repair that <unk> and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night I walked into Facebook contacted some of them, and the next morning the answer was so overwhelming and positive that I knew we had to try.
So we started <unk> the photos.
This was the first of all.
I wasn't too <unk> but where the water had <unk> the face of the girl was supposed to be <unk> with a lot of precision and <unk>
Anyway, that girl would not have the aspect of her himself, and that would be as tragic as having the photo <unk>
With the passage of time, they got more and more pictures and they needed more <unk> so I walked into Facebook and <unk> and five days later 80 people from 12 countries volunteered to help.
In two weeks I had 150 people <unk> people from <unk>
In Japan, in July, we <unk> to <unk> a town neighbor in the north of <unk>
Once a week we use our scanner in the libraries of temporary <unk> that had been <unk> where people would reclaim their photos.
The time that <unk> in <unk> is a different story, it depended on the <unk> of the photos.
It could make an hour. It could be <unk>
It could be <unk>
This <unk> had to draw almost by hand using the areas whose color and detail the water was not destroyed.
It took a long time.
And the water destroyed all of these pictures <unk> in seawater, covered with bacteria, with seaweed, even with oil -- all this thing along with the time of time I continue to <unk> it was a major part of the project.
We couldn't <unk> the picture unless it was <unk> dry and had been <unk> by his <unk>
We had lucky <unk>
We have the guide to a remarkable <unk>
It's very easy to hurt even more the photos already <unk>
As I once said, the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures was sort of lucky enough to the photos.
And he had started to <unk> herself but stopped by realizing that the <unk> even more.
I also had <unk>
Without them, the images of their husband and his own face would not have been <unk> we could actually <unk> the images in a single photo and <unk> the full picture.
When they collected their pictures shared something about his story with us.
Some colleagues of her husband found the pictures at a fire department between the rubble of a long distance from where he used to be his house, but his colleagues would <unk>
The tsunami, her husband was the experimenter <unk> the barriers to the wave.
It had to go inside the water while <unk> <unk>
Your small children, not as small now, but their two children were in school in different schools.
One of them was trapped in the water.
He took her a week to find his family and know that everybody had survived.
The day I gave him her photographs her son was <unk>
For her, despite all this, those pictures were the best gift I could tell you something that he could go back to look, something that could remember from the past that would not have been marked by that day day when everything in his life changed or was destroyed.
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined that <unk> hundreds of them helped us to clean up more than 13,000 photographs -- the great majority of <unk> -- the great majority came back to their own <unk>
Over 500 volunteers from all over the world helped us give back to 90 families -- hundreds of photos completely <unk> and <unk>
During this time, we actually don't spend over <unk> dollars in equipment and materials, most ink <unk>
We take pictures.
A picture is a memory of someone or something, a relationship, somebody wanted.
They are <unk> from our memories and stories, the last thing we would take for us, but the first thing we would take to look for.
And this is what the project was about to restore little bits of mankind, to return someone else to connection to the past.
When a picture like this gets back to somebody, it's a huge difference in the life of the person who get it.
This project also made a big difference in the life of <unk>
Some of them connected with something larger, to give back something, using their talent to something that are not thin <unk>
To end up I would like to read this electronic email -- I sent it Cindy on the day that I came back from Japan after six months.
As I <unk> I couldn't stop thinking about people and the stories shown in the images.
One particular one, a photo with women of different ages from the grandmother to the little little little girl gathering a baby, gathering a baby, <unk> me because a little bit of my family -- my grandmother, my mother, I and my <unk> daughter, <unk>
In the whole world, in all the very few of our basic needs are the same, right?
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> inspired us to wonder and curiosity with this picture of a bullet that goes through an apple in an exhibition in one millionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go to a million times faster and see the world not a million or a billion or a billion frames per second.
I present to you a new kind of <unk> <unk> a new technique so fast that you can create videos in slow motion of light in motion.
And with that we can create cameras that can see after the <unk> beyond the line of vision, or see the inside of the body without using X-ray and challenging the camera idea.
If I take a laser pointer and I switch on it and put it on a <unk> second or a number of <unk> to create a pile of photons from just a wide wide width of a single <unk>
And that package of photons, that <unk> travel at the speed of light, and, again, a million times faster than a common bullet than a king bullet <unk>
If we take that bullet and this package of photons and <unk> in this bottle, how do these photons are spreading into this <unk>
What's the aspect of light in <unk> camera.
Now, all this --  -- remember, this all happens in less than a <unk> is what it takes to travel the light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so that you can see the light in motion.
Coca-Cola is not <unk> this research.  <unk> a lot of things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what's going on.
The pulse, our <unk> comes into a bottle of photons that starts to <unk> and that inside, it starts to <unk>
Some of the light <unk> goes to the table, and we started seeing these <unk>
Many of the photons finally come to the lid and then explode in several directions.
As you can see, there's a kind of air bubble that bounces inside the inside.
At that time, the waves travel around the table and because of the reflections of the bottle, you see at the bottom of the bottle, after several boxes, that the insights will <unk>
Now, if we take a bullet and current and we make it go down the same distance and we see it in slow motion at about 10 billion times, how much they think it would take us to see that film?
A day? Actually a whole year.
It would be a very boring film -- from a single bullet in motion.
And what about testing with nature <unk>
You can see the waves that <unk> from the table, of the tomato table, and the wall of the background.
It's like throwing a stone on a pond.
It's the way nature paints a picture, I thought, you know, a <unk> at the same time, but of course, our eyes see a real composition here.
But if you look at one more and more of this <unk> you'll realize that, as the light <unk> it is still <unk>
Why? Because the tomato is <unk> and the light bounces back into its inside and it turns out after various <unk> of a second.
In the future, when this <unk> is in your phone, you're going to be able to go to the supermarket and check if the fruit is grown without having to <unk>
So what do we create is this camera at <unk>
As photographers -- you know, if we take a <unk> picture, it goes very little off.
But we're going to go to a billion times faster than the shortest <unk> so you just get into some light.
We sent that <unk> that package of photons, millions of times, and we recorded over and we recorded over and again with a very <unk> <unk> we took those data <unk> and <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all of those data in crude and <unk> <unk>
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible, actually.
And if a new power of a <unk> future would allow you to see after the <unk>
The idea is that we could throw some light on the door. You're going to go into the room, a part will reflect on the door, and from there to the camera.
And we could get those multiple <unk> light bulbs.
It's not science fiction. We already built it.
On the left, is our <unk>
Behind the wall is a dummy and <unk> light on the door.
And after the publication of our paper in Nature <unk>
And a tiny fraction of the photons will go back to the camera but interestingly, in slightly different times.
And as we have a camera that works that fast, our <unk> has unique capability.
It has very good time <unk> and it can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances to the door, and also to the hidden objects but we don't know what the dot corresponds to how a distance.
By projecting a laser -- you can record a picture, you know, in the screen, it really doesn't make any sense.
But we will take a lot of images like this, dozens of images, the <unk> and we will try to analyze the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we can see the <unk> object.
Can we see it <unk>
This is our reconstruction of it.
We have things to explore before we get this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that <unk> collisions with what's on the back of the curve, right?
Or we could look for survivors in dangerous conditions by looking at the light reflected through the open windows.
Or we could build <unk> that can be able to see inside of the body through <unk> and the same for <unk>
But of course, because of the tissue and the blood this is quite hard, and so actually this is a request to scientists so that they start thinking about <unk> as a new tool <unk> to solve the problems of <unk> in the next generation.
Just as <unk> <unk> himself a scientist, became the science in art, an art of <unk> photographs.
And I realized that all of the data <unk> that we collected every time is not just for scientific visualizations but we can see that we can see it.
It creates a new form of computational photography with slow motion and complex <unk>
And let's look at those waves, remember, the time between each one of those waves is just a few <unk> of a second.
But here also happens something fun.
If we look at waves under the <unk> these are going on, from us.
The waves should move towards us.
What happens here?
It turns out that as we are recording almost at the speed of light, we have weird effects -- Einstein would have loved this image.
The order that events occur in the world sometimes are going to be invested in the camera.
We <unk> the corresponding warping of space and time, we can fix this <unk>
It's already time. Thank you.
Hi. That's my mobile phone.
A mobile phone can <unk> your life, and it gives you individual freedom.
With a mobile phone, a crime against humankind in Syria.
With a mobile phone you can tweet a message in Egypt.
With a mobile phone you can record a song, put it to <unk> and get famous.
This is all possible with a cell phone.
I'm a <unk> of 1984 and I live in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to that moment, to this city.
Here you can see hundreds of thousands of people who are looking for a change.
This is the fall.
Who would have a phone here?
<unk>
Raise your mobile phone.
<unk> a Android, a Blackberry, wow!
It's a lot. Almost everyone today has a cell phone.
But today I'm talking about my mobile, and how I changed my life.
I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35 <unk> of information.
<unk> raw data.
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006 the E.U. of the E.U. presented a <unk>
<unk> <unk>
This allows every single telephone company, every single telephone company, every single Internet <unk> has to store a whole range of information <unk>
Who calls <unk> who sends an email to <unk>
Who sent a text to <unk>
And if we use mobile phone, where we are.
All of this information is stored for at least six months, and to two years, in your phone company, or the Internet provider or the Internet.
And in all Europe, people stood up and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this <unk>
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the phone to the Internet providers -- all of this information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, priests, everybody said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about 10,000 people who came out to the streets of Berlin and they said, <unk> not <unk>
And some of them even said this would be <unk> <unk>
The <unk> was the secret police of Germany.
And I also wondered if this really works.
Can you store all of this information about us?
Every time I use your <unk>
So I asked my phone phone -- <unk> <unk> who was then the largest telephone company in Germany, and please get all the information that had about me.
I asked them once, and I went back to <unk> and I didn't get a concrete answer, it was all <unk>
But then I said, "I want to have this information because you're <unk> my life.
So I decided to take a lawsuit for that, because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said no, we're not going to give you this information.
At the end of it, a deal.
<unk> the demand and they sent me the information that I <unk>
Meanwhile, the Veterans' Court <unk> I failed the <unk> for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly little brown with a CD inside.
And in the CD there was this.
Thirty and five thousand <unk> 30 lines of information.
At first I saw them, and I said, well, it's an enormous file, OK.
But after a time I realized that it's my life.
There are six months of my life in this archive.
It was a little bit <unk> what should I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where I step at night, what am I doing.
But then I said, I want this information to <unk>
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what the retention of data.
So, along with <unk> <unk> and Open King City, we did this.
This is a <unk> visualization of my life.
You can zoom in and slowly go back and forward.
You can see every step I do.
And you can see how I'm going to <unk> on train to <unk> and how often I call it the way.
This is all possible with this information.
That's a little scary.
But it's not just me.
It's all of us.
First of all, there are things like, I call my wife and she calls me a couple of times.
Then they call me some friends and they're called each other.
And then one calls the other, and the other one to the other, and we end up with this great communication network.
You can see how people communicate each other to what time they call each other, what time they are to sleep.
You can see all this.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what the society is.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the form of your society, because you know who talks to whom, who sends an email to whom, all of this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and for two years.
As I said at the beginning, imagine if all these people in the streets in Berlin, in the fall of 1989, had a mobile phone in our pocket.
And the <unk> had known who was involved in this protest, and if the <unk> had known who were the leaders, this would never have happened.
The fall of the Berlin Wall may never have happened.
And as a result, neither is the <unk> of <unk>
Because today the state agencies and companies want to store so much information from us as possible within and off the web.
They want to have the possibility to follow our lives, and they want to be <unk> forever.
But <unk> and living in the digital age, it's not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for the <unk>
You have to fight for that every day.
When you go home to your friends that privacy is a 21st century value and it's not very <unk>
When you go home, <unk> your representative of the fact that just because companies and state agencies can store some information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what information you store from you.
So in the future, every time you use their mobile phones to give them to remember that they have to fight for the <unk> in the digital era.
Thank you.
Hello TEDWomen, what happens?
It's not enough.
Hello TEDWomen, what happens?
I call myself <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor who brought me to the world.
<unk> my mom six times in six different address, <unk> the poor of me in the process.
As a result, I have cerebral palsy, so we <unk> all the time.
<unk>
It's <unk> I'm like a mixture of <unk>
And Muhammad <unk>
<unk> is not genetics.
It's not <unk> it can't be <unk>
No one <unk> the <unk> of my mother and not <unk> because my parents were prime brothers, though they are.
It's just happening by accidents, like the one that happened to birth.
Now, I'm not a source of inspiration -- and I don't want any of you in the room.
It feels bad for me, because at some point of life, you wish to be disabled
Let's go for a ride.
Christmas Christmas -- they're in the shopping mall, drive in circles looking for parking and what do you see?
16 empty places for disabled
And they think, "God, I can be at least a little bit <unk>
In addition, I have to tell you, I have 99 problems, and the P. C. It's just one of them.
There's one <unk> of the <unk> I won the gold medal.
I'm <unk> Muslim woman, <unk> disabled in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, you might have to.
I'm from Park <unk> in New Jersey.
I always loved my neighborhood and my illness had the same <unk>
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my home to New York, it might.
A lot of people with cerebral palsy, not <unk> but my parents don't believe in <unk>
The mantra of my father was, "Can you <unk> <unk> <unk>
If my three older sisters <unk> I <unk>
If my three older sisters went to public school, my parents would go to the school system, and they were <unk> that I was also out there, and if we were not <unk> every single note -- all of my mother's <unk>
My father taught me to walk the five years putting my <unk> on his feet and just walking.
Another approach that I used to do was to hang on a dollar in front of me so that you can do it.
The <unk> that I carry on was very strong and ...
Yes. The first day in the kindergarten was walking like a <unk> <unk> who has received a lot of <unk>
By growing up, there were only six Arabs in my city and were all of the family.
Now there are 20 Arabic, and they're still all of the family --  I think no one realized we weren't <unk>
This was before 9/11, and the politicians would think appropriate to use <unk> to the <unk> as a campaign.
People who grew up with no problems with my faith.
However, it seemed to be a lot of <unk> out of hunger during the <unk>
I would tell them that I had enough fat to live in three months and lived in the dawn of the dawn at sunset it's very easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yeah, in <unk> it's crazy.  My parents couldn't afford the physical therapy, so I sent to dance school.
I learned to dance with <unk> or whatever I can walk with <unk>
I'm in New Jersey, and I want to be <unk> so if my friends used <unk> I too.
And when my friends were going to spend a summer vacation on the coast of Jersey, I was not going.
I spent my summers in a war zone, because my parents were afraid if not back to Palestine all the <unk> are going to be <unk> in <unk>
On a summer vacation often my father was trying to <unk> so I was drinking milk of <unk> and they were drinking milk and warm on the back, I was stuck in the <unk> Sea, and I remember the water <unk> my eyes and I was like, <unk> <unk>
But the <unk> cure was the yoga.
I must say it's very boring, but before doing yoga it was a comedian in <unk> that I could not wear <unk> <unk>
And now I can focus on your head.
My parents would take this idea that I could do anything, which no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be in the <unk> Hospital.
I went to college through positive discrimination and I got a grant to the <unk> University of the State of Arizona, because it was in all the <unk>
It was like the <unk> of the theater.
Everyone was <unk>
I did all the tasks of the least <unk> tasks I took on the top note in my classes and also in their classrooms.
Every time I did a scene of <unk> my <unk> <unk>
But I never got a role.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to do a work called <unk> so slow in Jackson.
It's a work of a girl with cerebral <unk>
I was a girl with cerebral <unk>
So I started screaming at the four <unk> <unk> <unk>
I have <unk> <unk>
At the end of the end, we <unk>
Thank God <unk> I finally am <unk>
I didn't get the paper.  They gave him <unk> Brown.
I went to <unk> running the director of the theater, crying out historically, as if somebody had killed my cat, ask her why and she told me that because they thought I couldn't do the stunt stunts
And I said, <unk> if I can't do the <unk> stunts I can't do the <unk>
It was a paper for the fact that he was literally born and was given to an <unk> actor.
College was mimicking my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> story of <unk> actors without disability for disabled papers.
I graduated home, and my first <unk> tour was like extra in a <unk>
My dream came true.
And I knew it would be <unk> to <unk> friend <unk> in a <unk>
Instead, I stayed there like a <unk> I didn't look more than the <unk> and it was clear to me that the <unk> of <unk> not <unk> <unk> <unk> not white, with disabilities.
Just <unk> to perfect people.
But there were exceptions to the rule.
I grew up watching <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had one thing in common: they were <unk>
So I became <unk>
On my first tour led <unk> New York City to New Jersey, and never forget the face of the first stand-up comedy that I took when she fell at the high speed of the New Jersey <unk> with a driver who had cerebral <unk>
I worked in clubs.
Some people say I'm the first <unk> of the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know they never heard that little <unk> rumor that women are not fun, and they find it very fun.
In 2003, my mother of another mother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the <unk> <unk> Festival of New York, now in his 10 year.
Our goal was to change the negative image of <unk> in media media and then remind you the <unk> of <unk> that <unk> and Arabic are not <unk>
It was much easier to fight the challenge of behavioral disability.
My great opportunity came in 2010.
I was as invited to the news program on the back of <unk> <unk>
I walked into a graduate dance, I went to a study dance, and I sat down to a study and sat in a wheelchair.
I looked at the director and I said, <unk> can give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I clinging to the <unk> desk to not go out of the screen during the <unk> and when I finished the interview, I was <unk>
I finally had my opportunity and <unk> I knew they wouldn't have me.
But not only Mr. <unk> went back to <unk> but I was just like he had a <unk> and she hit my chair.
Something like a lot of fun I learned with Keith <unk> was that people on the Internet are <unk>
It is said that children are <unk> but they never get <unk> and no older people.
All of a sudden, my online disability became an object of <unk>
I put clips online with comments like, "Why do you <unk>
"It's <unk>
And my favorite <unk> <unk> <unk>
What disease does it?
We should really pray for her."
One guy suggested I even would add my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is as visual as race.
If somebody in the wheelchair can't make <unk> then you can't do somebody in a wheelchair.
<unk> are the <unk> Yeah, man.
<unk> are the largest minority in the world, and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment.
The doctors were saying not to <unk> but I'm here in front of you.
Yet, of having grown up with media, I don't think we <unk>
I hope that together we can create more positive images of disability in media and everyday life.
Maybe if there were more positive images, that would be less hate on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we still need the whole society to teach our children.
My <unk> journey has led me to very spectacular places.
I came to <unk> by the red carpet <unk> by the <unk> Susan <unk> and the infamous <unk> <unk>
I came to act on a film with Adam <unk> and working with my <unk> this incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the Arab world has become <unk>
I was <unk> a great state of New Jersey in the <unk> of 2008.
And I founded <unk> children of <unk> a charity to give children Palestinians who are a tiniest part of what my parents were <unk>
It was the only time my father saw me act live, and I do this talk to his memory.
<unk> in peace, <unk>
I call myself <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can.
I'd like to tell you a story about a child of a small people.
I don't know their name, but I know his story.
She lives in a little town in the South <unk>
This town is near <unk>
<unk> <unk> small people to poverty and the edge of the <unk>
Without anything for him there, it goes to the big city, in this case, <unk> the capital of Somalia.
When it comes there, there are no opportunities, there's no work, no more of the future.
He's just living in a tent in the city outside of <unk>
After maybe a year <unk> nothing.
One day he was about a guy who offers him to take it to <unk> after dinner, and <unk>
He knows a <unk> group of people who give him a break.
She gets a little bit of money to buy new clothes money to send your family home, your family.
They presented a young guy.
They finally get home.
It starts a new life.
It has a life of life.
One beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky bursts a car bomb.
That little boy of that little town with dreams of the great city was the terrorist bomber -- and that <unk> group of people were the <unk> a terrorist organization connected to al Qaeda.
So how did the story of a young people in a little town trying to fulfill their dreams in the city end with him <unk>
He was waiting for him.
I was waiting for an opportunity, hoping to start his future, hoping for a future perspective, and this was the first thing he arrived.
This was the first thing that put it out of what we call the <unk> period.
And their story is repeated in urban centers around the world.
It's the story of the <unk> <unk> urban urban <unk> riots in London, who are looking for something beyond the <unk> of <unk>
For the young people, the promise of the city, the great dream of the city is the opportunity of <unk> jobs, but young people don't participate in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often youth who suffers from the highest rates of unemployment.
By 2030, three of five people who live in cities are going to be under 18 years.
If we don't include young people in the growth of our cities, if they don't give them opportunities, the story of the <unk> of <unk> the door of access to terror, to violence, to <unk> will be the history of cities.
And in my hometown of birth, 70 percent of the young people are <unk>
70 percent don't work, it's not going to school.
They do nothing.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit the hospital Hospital where I was born.
I remember being in the hospital <unk> to <unk> thinking, and if I had never gone?
And if I'd been forced to be in that same <unk> <unk>
I would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to harbor some youth leaders at a business force.
They were going to be 90 percent youth leaders.
We sat down and we had the rain of ideas about solutions to the big challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He was at the University of <unk> <unk>
There was no job, no opportunities.
And I remember when he said to me, that because I was a graduate college college, it was the perfect white college for Al <unk> and other organizations to be <unk>
They were looking for people like him.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the biggest obstacle to get from point A to B is the streets.
<unk> years of civil war have completely destroyed the traffic system and a motorcycle may be the easiest way to <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and <unk>
A company started from <unk>
It started <unk> motorcycles to local residents who normally couldn't afford them.
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of his family and friends, and his dream is sometime to expand hundreds of motorcycles over the next three years.
Why is this a different story?
What does this story do?
I think its ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the corporate spirit, and I think the business spirit can be the most powerful tool against <unk> <unk>
<unk> young people to be the creators of the economic opportunities that are looking so <unk>
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to tell you about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was <unk> to train some of the young people at the summit of business initiative and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of business <unk>
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen in over 22 years, and until recently, until Mohamed came, if you wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were from plastic sent from abroad.
If you ask someone, "When was the last time you saw <unk> <unk>
For those who grew up for the civil war, the answer would be: <unk>
So, Mohamed saw an opportunity.
It started a company of <unk> and <unk> design.
He created a farm outside of <unk> and he started growing <unk> and <unk> who said they could survive the hard climate of <unk>
And it started the <unk> of flowers for <unk> creating gardens in the houses, and the businesses in the city, and now he's working on creating the world's first <unk> public park in 22 years.
There are no public parks in <unk>
It wants to create a space where families -- the young families, they can go together, and, as he says, smell my pink <unk>
By the way, he's not growing pink because they use a lot of water.
So the first step is to inspire the young people, and in that room, the presence of Mohamed had a really profound impact on young people.
They had never thought of starting a business.
They had thought to work for an NGO, working for the government, but their story, their innovation, actually had a strong impact on them.
They forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
I encouraged her to believe that they could be entrepreneurs, that they could be <unk> of change.
For the end of the day, they already had innovative solutions to some of the biggest challenges facing the city.
<unk> solutions for local problems.
So, inspiring the young people to create a social spirit culture, it's really a big step, but young people need capital to make their ideas happen.
They need experience and orientation to bring them into development and put out of their businesses.
<unk> young people with the resources they need, <unk> the support that they need to move from conception to the creation, and create real <unk> for urban growth.
For me, the business spirit is something more than starting a business.
It's to create a social impact.
Mohamed is not simply selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
His Park of <unk> this is how they call it when you can transform the way people see their city.
<unk> I hired kids from the street to help rent and keep <unk> for him.
He gave them the opportunity to escape the <unk> <unk> <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is to become the young people in entrepreneurs, <unk> and eat their innovation and they will have more stories about flowers and Parks of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went to <unk> with my dad in the <unk> <unk> area in the New York state of New York.
It was a beautiful day.
The forest <unk>
The sun was making the leaves <unk> like a <unk> and not being on the way that we <unk> we could almost pretend we were the first human beings on <unk> on the ground.
We got to our camp.
It was a shed in a <unk> with sight to a beautiful <unk> lake when I discovered something horrible as I discovered it.
Behind the shed was a <unk> of about four square meters with <unk> <unk> balls of aluminum paper balls and old <unk>
And I was <unk> I was very angry and incredibly <unk>
The <unk> who were too lazy to pull out what they thought they were going to clean up their <unk>
That question I kept on with me, and he was <unk> a little bit.
Who clean our <unk>
No matter how a <unk> or where do you get <unk> <unk> who clean our trash in <unk>
Who clean our trash in Rio or Paris or <unk>
Here in New York, the Department of <unk> clean our trash, and by the reason of 11 tons of waste and two thousand tons of <unk> products every day.
I wanted to know as individuals.
I wanted to understand who that work.
What do you feel like to use the uniform and take that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and walked through her pathways, and I interviewed people in office and facilities across the city, and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
I needed to go a lot more.
So I started working like <unk>
Now I wouldn't just travel in the trucks. I was <unk>
And operated the mechanical <unk> and the snow bar.
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
Everybody asks about the smell.
It's there, but it's not as <unk> as you believe, and in the days that it's very strong one <unk> quickly.
It costs a lot to get used to weight.
I met people who had worked on it for several years, and their bodies were still <unk> the weight of taking on their body of garbage all the weeks.
It's also danger.
According to the Bureau of <unk> <unk> <unk> is one of the ten most dangerous <unk> in the country, and I learned the reason.
You're coming out and getting out in the traffic all day and they're blowing around around you.
They just want to be <unk> so in general the driver is not paying attention.
That's very bad for the <unk>
And also the garbage itself is full of dangers that are often left from the truck and cause terrible <unk>
I also learned about the relentless of garbage.
When you get out of the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that the garbage is like a force of nature itself.
Never let come.
It's also like a breathing way or circulation.
You should always be in motion.
And the stigma.
It seems to me that stigma is especially ironic because I believe strongly that waste of waste is the most important workforce in the streets of the city, for three reasons.
They're the first protective <unk>
If you don't get rid of the waste of how efficient it gets efficient and effective at every day, this starts to <unk> its dangers and its dangers inherent in very real ways.
We had controlled for decades and centuries they come back and start <unk>
The economy needs them.
If we can't get rid of the old stuff, we don't have space for what the market engines begin to fail when it is in danger the consumption of the economy.
I'm not advocating for capitalism, just <unk> your relationship.
And then there is what I call our average speed of everyday <unk>
With that, I mean by just the speed that we get used to move in the <unk>
We are usually not <unk> we don't stop and clean up to clean up or take our coffee cup -- our bag of the <unk> our water <unk>
We used them, we <unk> we forget them, because we know that there is a job force on the other side that would take to it.
So today, I want to suggest to you a couple of ways to think about collecting waste that maybe help reduce the stigma and <unk> in that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city.
Her work, I think, is almost <unk>
They're on the street every day, <unk>
They use a uniform in many cities.
You know when they <unk>
And their work allows us to do our own.
They're almost a way of relief.
The flow that keep us except for ourselves, from our own <unk> our <unk> and that flow always has to stay in one way or another.
One day after the 11th of September 2001, I heard the <unk> of a collection of waste in the street, grabbed my little son and I went down the stairs <unk> and there was a man doing his journey of recycled paper as he did all the <unk>
And I tried to thank him for doing his work that particular day, but I started crying.
And he looked at me and just <unk> and said, "We're going to be okay.
We're going to be okay."
Shortly after that I began to investigate waste of waste and I went back to see that man.
It's called <unk> and we worked together a lot of times and we made good friends.
I want to believe that <unk> was right.
We're going to be fine.
But in our efforts to <unk> the way we exist on this planet as species we have to include and have in account all the costs, even the very real human cost of labor.
The waste of the city is what we think when we talk about garbage, they represent three percent of the amount of waste of the nation.
It's a remarkable <unk>
So in the flow of their days and their lives, the next one to see someone whose job is to clean up the garbage of you, <unk> a moment to <unk>
<unk> a moment to tell you, thank you.
My work focuses on the connection to think about our community life to be part of the environment where architecture is born naturally about the conditions and regional traditions.
Today I brought two recent projects now to be an example of this.
Both projects are located in emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
They also share the fact that different analysis from different perspectives become an essential part of the end of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a shopping center in the capital of Ethiopia, Addis Ababa <unk>
This is the kind of construction that showed us as an example, to my team and me about what we had to design.
At first, the first thing I thought was, "I want to go out <unk>
After seeing some of these buildings there are many in the city -- we realized that there are three important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores where people can't afford to buy things.
Second, you need to use a lot of energy because the skin with crystal generates heat into the interior, so you need a lot of <unk>
In a city where this shouldn't happen because it's about a temperate climate that goes 20 to 25 degrees across the entire year.
And thirdly, what has nothing to do with Africa and not Ethiopia.
It's a <unk> for a very rich place in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, I was really captivated with the old market that is this structure of the free air where thousands of people, they go and buy things every day to small <unk>
There is also that idea of using public space to generate external activity.
So I thought, that was what I really wanted to design, not a commercial center.
But the question was how to build a modern <unk> of several stories by applying these principles.
The next challenge was presented to the survey of the site, which is located in a very large area of the city, where much of the buildings that we now see in the image, didn't exist.
And it's also between two parallel streets that are not communicating on an extension of hundreds of feet.
So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets, putting all the entries in the building.
And this spreads by a <unk> <unk> that creates an open air space in the building that <unk> in its own way, the sun and rain.
And around this space, we have applied the idea of the market with small businesses, which changes on every floor because of the form of space.
I also thought, how to bridge the building?
I wanted to find a solution that would fit the local climate conditions.
And I started thinking about a tissue that was similar to a concrete shell, with <unk> to allow the air to the air, and also from light, but in a <unk> way.
Then we get inspiration from these beautiful buttons in the <unk>
They have properties of fractal geometry. And this helped me model <unk>
We're building that with these little <unk> pieces that are the windows that leave the air and light in a controlled way inside of the building.
This is <unk> with these little <unk> crystals that use the inside of the building of the building to illuminate the building at night.
With these ideas it wasn't easy to convince developers because they thought, "That's not a commercial center -- it wasn't what they <unk>
But ultimately, we all realized that this market idea was going to be much more profitable than the commercial center because at the end of the mall there were more local to sell.
And also the idea of the facade was much more inexpensive -- not just because of the material compared to glass, but also because it was no longer necessary to have air conditioning.
So we got certain savings in the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to achieve the energy <unk> for the building in a city where electricity is short almost every day.
So we got a big advantage by putting <unk> on the ceiling.
And then under those panels we think of the roof as a new public space with areas of meeting and bars that would create this urban oasis of the urban <unk>
And these <unk> on the roof, which together collect water to the inner <unk>
It's expected for the beginning of the next year, because we go through the fifth floor of the construction floor.
The second example is a professor of 2,000 apartments and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to perform a big project, the biggest thing that I have designed, I needed not only to understand the city of Tunisia, but also to their environment, its tradition and culture.
During that analysis I had a special attention in <unk> a <unk> structure that was surrounded by a wall with 12 connected doors of access.
When I went to place, the first design operation, we did this was to expand existing streets and creating 12 early blocks similar in size and characteristics that there are in Barcelona and other cities of Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we select some strategic points in relation to the idea of the <unk> doors with straight lines, and this changed the initial model.
And the last operation, was to think of the cell, the little cell in the project, like the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would be the best orientation for an apartment in the <unk> climate.
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and therefore a natural ventilation.
So we had a scheme to make sure that most of the apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that's almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with <unk> and then on the low plant we have all the connections for <unk>
And it also responds to local norms who set up a greater density at higher levels and a smaller density on the ground plant.
And it also reinforces this idea of the doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost like giving up the community space busy building building space.
It's where all the neighbors, can go up and <unk> and do activities like running a <unk> race in the morning, or jump from one building to another building.
These two examples, have a common approach to design process.
And also, they're in emerging countries, where you can see the cities that are literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in people's lives of people changes the local communities and local economies at the same rate as buildings.
For this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture looking for simple solutions, but <unk> that improve the relationship between the community and the environment that have as objective is to connect nature with people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl joined our class. It was as remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
I had huge amounts of bright hair and a very bright little <unk> of <unk> <unk> it was so strong for the state capitals of the states, very good for <unk>
I ended up that year and I was full of jealousy, until I <unk> my sinister plan.
One day I stayed in a time after the <unk> was a little afternoon, and I hid in the girls' bathroom.
When the coast was <unk> salt, I walked into the classroom, I took on the classroom, I took the grades.
And then I did.
<unk> the ratings of my <unk> just a little bit, just a little bit <unk>
All like this.  And I set up to bring the book back to the <unk> but to see, some of my other guys had very good notes as well.
So in a <unk> <unk> the notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put them every day of <unk> and myself a row out of the way, just to be there, because it <unk>
I'm still surprised what I did.
I don't understand how the idea happened.
I don't understand why I felt good at it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I never <unk>
It's that it was all a obvious thing to do.
I never <unk>
But above all, I was bothered by the reason why I was bothered by this little little little little little bit of a little bit of good <unk>
I <unk> jealousy.
They're so <unk> and so <unk>
We know that babies suffer from jealousy.
The <unk> birds are very <unk>
We know that <unk> are the number one cause of spouses in the U.S.
And yet, I've never seen a study that <unk> the atom or the long duration or the sadness.
And so you have to go to the fiction, because the novels are like the lab in which <unk> in all of their potential forms.
In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if there was no jealousy, <unk> there would be no literature.
Well, I wouldn't have <unk> the <unk> wouldn't have <unk>
There was no <unk> king <unk> and <unk> and a <unk>
There was no Shakespeare.
I was taking high school lists, because we'd be losing "The <unk> and the <unk> would not have <unk> no <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Without jealousy, there's no <unk> I know it's fashionable to say that <unk> has the answers for everything, and in terms of jealousy, almost you have all of them.
This year has been 100 years of his work -- "In the <unk> time, the most <unk> study of sexual <unk> and also from ordinary <unk> all you might have.  And thinking about <unk> we have the <unk> details -- right?
We think of a kid trying to reconcile sleep.
We think about a <unk> <unk>
We forgot about how hard that image.
We forgot how relentless it is.
I mean, it's books that Virginia <unk> said they were as hard as <unk> of cat.
I don't know what is cat <unk> but we assume it's <unk>
Let's see why they go so well together, the novel and the <unk> the <unk> and <unk>
It's going to be very obvious as the jealousy, who are reduced to the person -- their wish, their <unk> are a narrative narrative <unk>
I don't know. I think we get very close to the bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel jealousy we tell ourselves a story.
A story about other people's lives, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel bad.
Being in <unk> and audience, we know exactly what <unk> <unk> to <unk> the knife isn't it?
The <unk> make us all <unk> <unk> and that's something I could understand.
Everything that she makes to get pleasure could give me pleasure maybe right now."
And it starts to say that story, and since then, <unk> says that every cool charm that <unk> detects on his lover -- he adds up to its collection of <unk> instruments in his private camera.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, the <unk> <unk> would have to abandon the country, if they wanted to break up with it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's hard work. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
It's an emotion <unk> You have to <unk>
And how are the <unk>
The <unk> get rid of the information.
<unk> use the details.
At the <unk> they like big bright hair and the cute little <unk> little <unk>
The <unk> came from the photos.
That's why Instagram is so successful --  <unk> links well language <unk> with jealousy.
When <unk> is in her chest agony of soon listening behind the gates and <unk> the <unk> of his lover -- then defends those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is <unk> but it's not different from the end of an old text or looking at a <unk>
He says, "They're a scientific research with real value.
<unk> is trying to prove that <unk> look <unk> and they make us seem <unk> but in their <unk> they are pursuit of knowledge, search for the truth, a painful truth, in fact, what to <unk> <unk> the more painful for the truth, better.
The pain, <unk> <unk> these were the tracks for wisdom of <unk>
He says, "A woman who we need to do, that makes us suffer, it causes us to make a range of much deeper and vital feelings than a wise man who can tell us.
It's telling us that we're going to look for <unk> women.
No. I think it's trying to say that <unk> give us ourselves.
And there is some other emotion that makes us <unk> this particular way.
There is some other emotion <unk> our <unk> our horrible ambition and our <unk>
Any other emotion that teaches us to look at with intensity so <unk>
Freud would write about it later.
One day, Freud visited by a young young woman who was consumed with the idea that his wife would <unk>
And Freud said that there was something weird on that man, who didn't <unk> in what his wife.
Well, she was <unk> everybody knew it.
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause.
But he was looking for things that he did his wife, without realizing any <unk> behaviors.
<unk> <unk> or not accidentally <unk> with a man?
Freud said that man was becoming the <unk> of the unconscious, of his wife.
<unk> are very good at this.
The novels really describe how <unk> do it to look at the intensity but without precision.
In fact, the more intensely <unk> we are, we are, more we become residents of fantasy.
And for this reason, I think, <unk> are taking us to do violent <unk>
<unk> drive us to behave in completely <unk> ways.
Now I'm thinking about me at eight years old, but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard on the news.
A woman from Michigan <unk> was captured by having created a fake Facebook account of the one who would send him messages to <unk> for a year.
For one year, a whole year.
She was trying to <unk> her new girlfriend of his former <unk> I have to confess that when or do this, I reacted with <unk>
Because, let's be realistic.
How big -- even though you do creativity. Right?
It's like <unk>
Like a <unk> Patricia <unk>
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She is a very strange, brilliant character.
It's the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> books that try to be <unk> <unk> our minds, and once we are in the sphere, in the realm of jealousy, the membrane that separates what it might be, can be <unk> in a second.
Take Tom <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> <unk> or wanting to want what you have to take to <unk> what you have once <unk> and it's under the floor -- you get out of your name, you take your rings, empty your bank accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the road for Tom <unk>
I can't give you <unk> around the world, as much as I wanted to.
It's a shame, because we live in times of envy.
We live in times of jealousy.
I mean, we're good citizens of social media, where the coin is <unk> right?
<unk> show us the <unk> I'm not safe.
So we're going to do what the characters are always doing when they're sure, when they're in front of a mystery.
Let's go to the <unk> of Baker Street and ask for <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> think about the curse <unk> in Professor <unk> that criminal genius.
But I've always had <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who needs <unk> <unk> needs the genius of <unk> but it bothers me.
Oh, it sounds so <unk>
<unk> needs their help, but it <unk> and <unk> with <unk> in each of the puzzles.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and finally in "The <unk> of <unk> Six once <unk> <unk> <unk> all over with his solution, <unk> back to <unk> and says, "We're not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We're proud of <unk>
And he says there's no person in <unk> <unk> who wouldn't want to be <unk> by hand.
It's one of the times that we see <unk> transferred in history. I think this is very emotional. That scene is also mysterious, right?
It seems to treat <unk> as a problem of geometry, no excitement.
You know, in a minute <unk> is the opposite side of <unk>
The next minute you're on the same side.
All of a sudden, <unk> allows you to admire that idea of being <unk>
Could I still be so simple?
What if <unk> are really a matter of geometry, just a question of where we allow ourselves to be in relation to the other?
Well, maybe we don't have to <unk> the excellence of the other.
We can relate to it.
But I like <unk> plans.
So as we expect that to happen, we remember that we have fiction to get it out.
It's only fiction -- the jealousy.
<unk> alone <unk> invites the table.
And look at what <unk> sweet <unk> the terrifying terrifying Tom <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We're in excellent company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
The 21st of July 1969, Buzz Aldrin jumped outside the <unk> of Apollo 11, 11 and landed on the Beaufort Sea.
Armstrong and <unk> were alone, but his presence in the <unk> surface was the culmination of a collective collective process.
The Apollo program was the largest place in peace time in American history.
To get to the moon, NASA spent about 180 billion 180 billion dollars a day, or four percent of the federal budget.
Apollo gave about 400,000 people about 400,000 people and asked the 20,000 companies, universities and government agencies.
People died people, including the crew for Apollo 1.
But before the program Apollo <unk> 24 men traveled to the moon.
<unk> walked over his surface, of whom went after death death last year, is now the most <unk>
So why do we <unk>
They didn't have a lot of <unk> <unk> pounds of old rocks, and something that 24 <unk> later, a new sense of <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why <unk> The cynical answer is that they were because President Kennedy wanted to demonstrate to the <unk> that this nation had better rockets.
But the words of Kennedy at the University of Rice in <unk> give us a better idea.
John F. <unk> <unk> Some people ask, why do you <unk>
Why turn it into our goal?
And you could also ask, why scale the most <unk>
35 years ago, why fly on the <unk>
Why plays Rice <unk>
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're difficult.
Jason <unk> For the <unk> the Apollo was not just a victory of the West about the last at the Cold War.
In the time, the stronger excitement was the <unk> of the powers of technology.
They were because it was really great to do it.
The landing on the moon happened in a context of a long list of <unk>
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the plane, penicillin and the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, they <unk> the <unk> and the <unk> of smallpox.
Technology seemed like to own what Alvin <unk> in 1970 called <unk> <unk>
For most of the history of mankind, we couldn't go faster than a horse or a ship <unk> but in 1969, the crew for Apollo 10 flew to 40,000 miles an hour.
From 1970, no human being has gone back to the moon.
No one has traveled faster than the crew for Apollo 10, and the optimism joyful about the power of technology has been <unk> to see that the problems that we imagine that the technology would solve as to go to Mars, to create clean energy, curing cancer, or feed the world population seems to be <unk>
I remember looking at the <unk> of Apollo 17.
I was five years old, and my mother told me that not <unk> the <unk> tube <unk> Saturn <unk>
I knew that this would be the last <unk> mission but I was absolutely sure that I would get to see colonies on Mars.
So that has happened to our ability to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We heard it all the time.
We've heard it over the last two days here, at TED.
It looks like the technologists would have <unk> us and had enriched with <unk> toys, things like <unk> apps and social media, or algorithms that speed up <unk>
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They've expanded and enriched our lives.
But we didn't forget the big problems of humanity.
What happened?
There's an explanation in the Silicon Valley in Silicon Valley, that <unk> that have been created less ambitious companies than <unk> from the years that they were <unk> at Intel and <unk> Apple and <unk>
Silicon Valley says markets are the guilty, in particular, the incentives that venture capitalists offer to entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the risk of risk caused the creation of <unk> ideas for the funding of <unk> problems or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
<unk> mostly what's wrong with <unk> Valley.
Even when the venture capitalists were at its high peak without worry about risk, they preferred small investment investment, no minute that they could go out in 10 years.
<unk> have always had trouble investing in technologies like energy, which need a tremendous amount of capital and development in the long term.
No, the reasons we can't solve the big problems are more complicated and deeper and profound.
Sometimes, we choose not to solve the big problems.
Could we go to Mars if you <unk>
NASA has even designed a plan.
But going to Mars would require a political decision that was popular and that will never happen.
We're not going to go to Mars because everybody thinks that there are more important things to do on Earth.
Sometimes, we can't solve the big problems because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of the world's energy consumption comes from sources of renewables like solar and wind and <unk> Less than two percent, and the reason is completely cheap.
Coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind, and oil is cheaper than the <unk>
We want to use alternative sources of energy that can compete in price, don't exist.
Now, technologists, entrepreneurs and economists agree on what policies and international treaties to <unk> the development of <unk> energy, <unk> a significant increase in research and development of energy, and some kind of control control control.
But there is no hope in the political climate that we're going to see a global energy policy or treaties in international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes the big problems that seemed technological, they turn out not to be.
We know for a long time time that famines are a result of failure in food <unk>
But 30 years of research has taught us that famines are political crisis that affect the distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like crops or systems for storage and food power, but there will be famines while there were bad governments.
Finally, big problems are sometimes <unk> a solution, because we don't understand the problem really.
The Nixon president declared the war to cancer in 1971, but soon we found that there are a lot of cancer, some <unk> <unk> of treatment, and only in the last 10 years seem to have been found effective and effective treatment treatments and viable.
The hard problems are difficult.
It's not true that we couldn't solve problems with technology.
We can and we can have -- but these four elements of being <unk> the political leaders and the population should want to solve the problem, the institutions must support the problem, it should really be a problem <unk> and we need to understand it.
The <unk> mission that has become something like a metaphor for the ability of technology to solve big problems, it serves with those <unk>
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There is no <unk> competition like the Cold War, there is no politician like John Kennedy that <unk> the hard and dangerous, and there's not a science mythology of science fiction like that of exploring the solar system.
In general, to go to the moon, it turned out to be simple.
I was just three days.
And really, I wasn't even <unk> no problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be more difficult to get.
God knows that we are not missing the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start with <unk> ideas that have about trust.
They're so common that they've become <unk> of our society.
I think they're three.
The first one is a <unk> there's been a huge decline of trust, which is a very general <unk>
The second is a goal: we should have more trust.
And the third is a <unk> we should get out of trust.
I think <unk> the goal and the task have been <unk>
What I'm going to try to tell you today is a different story about a <unk> a goal and a task, that I think gives a more clear idea about the subject.
So first <unk> why people think that trust has <unk>
And if I think about the basis of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
It turns me to think that there may be <unk> in some activities or institutions that could have risen in others.
I don't have that.
But I can turn to the surveys of view, and the opinion polls are supposedly the source of the belief that trust has decreased.
When you look at the opinion polls over time, there's not many evidence of it.
I mean, the people who are <unk> 20 years ago, mostly journalists and politicians, continue to <unk> the same <unk>
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years ago, they are still pretty <unk> the judges, the judges, the judges, the <unk>
The rest of us are in the middle, and, by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost exactly half the road.
But this is enough?
What <unk> polls are, of course, views.
What else can you <unk>
What you're looking at is the <unk> attitudes, that people participate when they do some questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if anybody would ask you, <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in <unk>
<unk> in <unk> teachers.
You probably ask for asking, "What for?"
And that would be a very <unk> response.
And you might say, when you've answered your question, "Well, I trust you in some, but in other no."
What's very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to deposit trust <unk>
We don't assume that the level of trust that we're going to feel for a certain kind of <unk> official or a person, it's going to be uniform in all cases.
I could, for example, say I trust a certain grade teacher that I know to give the reading, but in no way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it was not a good <unk>
I could trust my <unk> friend to keep a conversation, but no, maybe you can keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we've got those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why we leave it all that knowledge when we think about trust in a more <unk> way.
I think these surveys are very bad tools, to measure the true standard confidence because they try to <unk> the good inherent judgment of trusting something or somebody.
Secondly, what happens to the goal?
The goal is to have more trust.
Frankly, I think it's a stupid goal.
It's not that goal that I <unk>
I tend to have more confidence in what is <unk> of trust, but not what it isn't.
Ultimately, I'm a <unk> of not trusting what is <unk>
And I think those people who were going to <unk> their savings with a very <unk> named Mr. <unk> and then disappeared with them, I think of them, and I think, well, yes, they were too <unk>
Having more confidence is not a smart goal in this life.
<unk> or <unk> with intelligence, that's the right target.
Once you say, yes, it says, yes, this means that what matters first is not the trust, but trustworthiness.
What this is about making a judgment on how trustworthy people are in certain ways.
And I think that to be able to do a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we find that one person is <unk> in commodities -- and it's responsible and honest, then we have a very good reason to trust it, because it's going to be worthy of trust.
But if, on the contrary, they're not <unk> we couldn't trust them.
I have friends who are <unk> and honest, but not <unk> in them to get a letter to the <unk> because they're <unk>
I have friends who are really sure that you can do certain things, but I see you actually <unk> your own <unk>
And I'm very happy to say that I think I don't have a lot of friends who are competent and responsible but extremely <unk>
If it's like this, I still haven't <unk>
But that's what we are <unk> to tell them before we trust.
<unk> is the answer.
<unk> is what we have to <unk>
And of course, it's hard.
In the last decades, we've tried to build systems of accounts for all kinds of institutions, professionals, officials and so forth, that make us easier the task to judge their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work like <unk>
And I remember one time I was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you see the problem is that it takes more time to make <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk>
And we found the same problem in all of our public life, and we <unk> that the accountability system that's meant to ensure <unk> and <unk> tests are actually doing the opposite.
What they do is <unk> the work of the people who have to do hard tasks, like the <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> as we say.
You probably all know the similar examples.
All of that, by the target.
I think the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if we were to be worthy of being worthy of trust and <unk> to the people that we're trustworthy and if you stop knowing whether other people, government or politicians are trustworthy.
It's not easy. It's the trial, the simple action, <unk> -- which doesn't make it properly.
Third, the task.
<unk> the task to rebuild the trust, puts things upside down.
It suggests that you and I should rebuild our trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can reconstruct a little bit of trustworthiness.
We can do it if they're two people, together, trying to improve trust.
But the trust, ultimately, it is signature because we treat other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have given to you.
You have to give them a lot of them in order so they can trust you.
You have to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, is because you can't react to all people, all the time.
But you also have to do <unk> evidence that you are worthy of trust.
How do you do it?
That is on every day, everywhere, does it make the ordinary people, <unk> very effectively.
I'll give you a simple commercial example.
The store where I buy my socks is said that I can <unk> without giving subjects.
I take them and get it back to the money, or they change them by the color of the color I want.
That's great. I rely on them because they themselves became vulnerable to me.
I think there's a great lesson on that.
If you become vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good proof that you're worthy of trust and you have trust in what you're saying.
So, in the end, I think what we're pointing is not very hard to <unk>
What people trust is in relationships, and in that framework, they can determine when and how the other person is worth worthy of trust.
Thank you.
Since the beginning of computers we have been <unk> to reduce the separation between us and the digital information, the separation between our material world and the world of the screen that imagination can be <unk>
This separation has been increasingly <unk> and more and more, to such a point today is less than one millimeter, the thickness of the glass of a <unk> and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone.
But I ask myself, and if I had no <unk>
So I started to imagine how we <unk>
So first created this tool that gets into the digital space, so that when the strong <unk> against the screen is transfers by his physical body at the pixel of the pixels.
Designers can <unk> their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can practice virtual organs underneath the screen.
So with this tool is breaking the barriers.
But the two hands still stay out of the screen.
How do you get inside and interact with digital information using the entire hands?
In the division of Science <unk> along with my mentor <unk> <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a small space on the keyboard in a digital digital area.
It <unk> a transparent bombsight with the chambers of depth of depth to detect the fingers and the face, you can now lift the hands of the keyboard, coming inside of the 3D space, and grab pixels directly with your hands.
Like the windows and archives have a location in real space, <unk> is as easy as catching a book of a <unk>
You can flip through the book and highlight the lines or words with the virtual touch sensor that are below every floating screen.
Architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with their hands.
In these examples, we are <unk> in the digital world.
And if we invest the papers and we make digital information come to us?
We have a lot of us would be bought and returned things on the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry about it.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a device mounted on your head or <unk> when the system understands the geometry of your body.
If we take this idea further, I thought, instead of just seeing pixels in space, how can we make physics so that we can <unk> and <unk>
How would a future like this?
At the Media Lab at MIT with my tutor Hiroshi <unk> and my collaborator <unk> Post, we created this only physical pixel <unk>
This imam <unk> behaving like a 3D pixel in space, which means that the computer means that the computer as users can move the object anywhere within this small three-dimensional space.
<unk> what we did was <unk> gravity and controlling movement through a combination of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And by programming the object, we release it from the constraints of time and space, which means that human movements can <unk> and go back to reproduce and stay forever in the physical world.
You can teach <unk> physically and the second takes for Michael Jordan, you can reproduce it as a physical reality the times that we want.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the motion of the planets, the physics, as opposed to <unk> or textbooks, this is a real and palpable experience that you can play and feel.
But what's more fascinating to change the physics of the computer is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our physical activities.
As you see, digital information is not just showing you something but to begin to act directly about us as part of the physical world around us without that we have to <unk> our world.
We started the talk today about a barrier, but if you <unk> that barrier, the only limit that's left is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was <unk> to become <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the 1950s.
When I was in first grade, the government wanted to <unk> a school for athletes with all expenses paid.
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become engineering, like them.
After surviving the Islamic Revolution -- they believed that there was just a <unk> path to <unk> a safe and <unk> job.
No matter if the work would like or not.
But my dream was to be an opera singer <unk>
This was me, in my imaginary piano.
An opera singer has to start <unk> from very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could go to the opera school.
I even wrote to the director of the school and the host of a radio show.
But no adult would take the idea.
No adult got me serious.
Only my friends <unk> but were kids, without authority, like me.
So at the age of 15 years, I knew it was too much more to train.
My dream never <unk>
<unk> that for the rest of my life a second class happiness was the only thing to aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I decided to look for another <unk>
No one to me wanted to <unk> OK.
I went to the books.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I came to the United States in 1995, and what were the first books that I was here?
Those who were <unk> in China, of course.
"The Good <unk> is about Chinese life <unk>
And it's not <unk> <unk> <unk>
The Bible is interesting, but weird.
That's a topic for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a <unk> <unk> to your father and your mother."
<unk> I told myself, "It's so different, and much better than I <unk>
So it became my tool to get out of this <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> relationship with my parents.
I find this with a new culture also led to my life of reading <unk>
<unk> a lot of perspectives.
For example, this map I found out to be out of place because this is what students in China learn.
I had never occurred to me that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves the perspective of people.
<unk> reading is not something new.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There is to research camps as religion and comparative literature.
<unk> and <unk> offers a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought that if the comparative reading worked for research, why not do it in <unk> life.
So I started reading books from two.
They may be <unk> <unk> <unk> from Walter <unk> <unk> <unk> David <unk> who were involved in a same <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
For <unk> <unk> are economic and spiritual <unk>
For Buddha, they're all <unk> lust, fear and duty to make it <unk> Interesting.
If you know other language, it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages.
<unk> <unk> <unk> Thomas <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> instead of falling into the translation, found that you can win a lot of it.
For example, it's through the translation that I realized that <unk> in Chinese literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
The books opened me a magic door to match people from the past and the present.
I know I'm not going to feel like I used or <unk>
Having a <unk> dream is really not anything compared to what many others have <unk>
I've come to believe that the realization is not the only purpose of a dream.
Their most important purpose is to connect with the place that dreams come from where the passion comes from, where happiness comes from.
Until a <unk> dream can do that for you.
And it's because of the books, that I'm here, happy, living again with purpose and clarity, most of the time.
So the books always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first client at <unk>
I was a Ph.D. student in clinical psychology in Berkeley.
She was a <unk> woman named <unk>
Alex came to the first session using jeans and a <unk> <unk> stood on the couch of my office -- took off the shoes and told me that I wanted to talk about his problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My class colleague had a <unk> like the first client.
And I got a <unk> I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could handle it.
But I didn't.
With the <unk> stories that Alex brought to the <unk> it made me easy only to move the head while it was <unk> the solution.
"The <unk> are the new <unk> saying Alex, and so I was looking at it, she was right.
You start to work after that, you get home later, it has children later, to death later.
For <unk> as Alex and I had moved on.
But shortly after that, my <unk> pushed me to push me to Alex that I would talk about her life <unk>
I was <unk>
I said, "Yes, he's coming out with guys under his category, <unk> with a <unk> head but not as if it was to marry him."
And then my squad <unk> said, "No, no, but maybe it's <unk> with the next one.
Also, the best time to work in marriage marriage is before they were <unk>
This is what psychologists call a <unk> moment.
It was when I realized that <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yes, people sit head after what they <unk> but this didn't make the <unk> of Alex to be a pause in its development.
This made the <unk> of Alex to be the perfect moment, and we were <unk>
So I realized, that this kind of benign <unk> was a real problem and had real consequences -- not only for Alex and his loving life, but for the careers, but for the careers, the future of <unk>
There's 50 million <unk> in the United States, today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if they believe that no one gets to adulthood without passing before the <unk>
Raise your hand if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk> here.
Oh, Yes! They're amazing.
If you work with <unk> they love a <unk> you remove sleep a <unk> I want to see. That's right. <unk> the <unk> really matter.
This is not just my view. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will happen to 35 years.
This means that eight out of 10 decisions and experiences and <unk> moments that shape their life will have happened to when you have 30 and <unk>
<unk> people are <unk>
This audience is going to be okay, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a race have an exponential impact on the amount of money that we <unk>
We know that more than half of Americans are married, they live or they're coming out with their future partner for 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up their second and final stage of growth in its <unk> and <unk> to <unk> which means that if there is something that you want to change of themselves, now is the moment to change it.
We know that the personality changes more times during their <unk> than anywhere else in life and we know that the female fertility gets to its top 28 and things become complicated to the <unk>
<unk> are the time for <unk> on their body and their options.
When we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first five years are crucial to language and attachment to the brain.
It's a moment in which your everyday life and common life has an impact on the person who <unk>
But what we don't hear is that there is something called adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in the adult development.
But this is not what the <unk> are listening.
<unk> talk about changes in the line of <unk>
Researchers call <unk> an extended adolescence.
The journalists would tell him <unk> names of <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we have considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines the <unk>
Leonard <unk> said that to get big things, you need a plan and not enough time.
It's not it?
What do you think happens when you get a <unk> in your head and you say, you have another 10 years to start your <unk>
Nothing happens.
They stole that person the sense of urgency and his ambition and it doesn't happen absolutely nothing.
And then every day, <unk> smart <unk> like you or their children and daughters come back to my office and say something like this: "I know that my boyfriend is not good for me, but this relationship doesn't notice. I'm just killing time."
Or they say, "Everybody says that as I start a race before the 30, all being <unk>
But then it starts going to sound like this: "My <unk> are <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
I had better escape the day I graduated from <unk>
And then it starts to sound like this: "My <unk> during the <unk> were like the game of chairs.
They were all running and <unk> but then at some point around the '30s, they turned the music and all started sitting on.
I didn't want to be the only one who got stop, so I sometimes think I married my husband because he was the closest chair when he had <unk>
Where are the <unk> here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds kind of very extreme but not <unk> the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for the <unk> there's a huge pressure on the <unk> and so many of you start a career, choose a city, to choose a city, and have two or three children in a much more short period of time.
Many of these things are not <unk> and there are research that start to show, which is much more difficult and stressful <unk> to do all of the <unk>
The middle-aged age crisis is not about buying red sporting cars.
It's about realizing you can't have the career you want now.
You see, you can't have the son you want now, or you can't give a brother to your son.
Many <unk> and <unk> you see themselves in the room, and I sat in the room, and they talk about their <unk> "What was I doing? What was you thinking?"
I want to change what the <unk> are doing and thinking.
Here's a story about how it might be.
It's a story about a woman called <unk>
At 25, Emma came to my office because it was, in his own words, having an identity.
He said he would like to work in art or in entertainment, but you still couldn't decide, and so I spent the last years working as a <unk>
As it was cheaper, I was living with a boyfriend, who showed the most <unk> than ambition.
And despite living a very difficult time, his previous life had been even more difficult.
<unk> often in our <unk> but then they woke up herself to say, "You don't choose her family, but she can choose his friends."
Well, one day, Emma put his head on his legs and <unk> for almost every hour.
I had just bought a new book book to <unk> and I had spent the whole morning <unk> with his many <unk> but then he sat down watching empty space that goes after words "In emergency words, please call <unk>
I was at the point of <unk> when he saw me and said, "Who is going to be for me if I have a <unk> accident.
Who is going to take care of me if I was <unk>
At that time, I got a lot of work to resist and I don't say, <unk>
What Emma needed was not a <unk> that really <unk>
Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was his opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex as to just sit while the 1950s.
So over the next few weeks and months, I told Emma three things that all <unk> man or woman deserves to know.
First of all, I told Emma who got rid of that identity crisis, and the identity capital of identity.
For identity, I mean to do something that add value to your person.
Doing something that's a investment in what they want to be later.
I didn't know the future of <unk> race and nobody knows the future of work, but I know this: <unk> identity capital makes an identity.
So now it's time for that work on the other side of the country, from that <unk> of that company you want to try it.
I'm not <unk> <unk> exploration, I'm <unk> exploration that I shouldn't count, that by the way, it's not exploration,
It's <unk>
I said to Emma that would explore jobs and make it count.
Secondly, I told Emma that urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great for you to get to the airport, but the <unk> who come together with friends with some similar minds are limited to whom you know what you know, how they think about, and where they work.
That new piece of capital -- that new person who will come out almost always comes from outside his <unk>
The new things come from what they are called the weak ties.
Yeah, half of the <unk> have a bad job or not work.
But the other half won't, and the weak ties are the way to <unk> this group.
Half of the work has never been <unk> so knowing the head of your neighbor is the way to get a job of not published.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information happens.
For the last but not least, Emma believed that you don't choose your family, but his friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but like <unk> Emma soon <unk> to her family when they have a partner and it exists their own family.
I told Emma the time to choose her family had come.
Maybe you think that 30 is better to sit in mind than 20 or even 25 and even 25 and I agree with you.
But to choose the person who you live now or <unk> now when every Facebook you start walking into the <unk> it's not progress.
The best moment to work in your marriage is before you have, and that involves being as intentional in love as you're at work.
<unk> your family has to be a conscious choice of who and what they want instead of just to work or kill time with whoever you are going to <unk> you.
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found the <unk> fellow of a cousin who worked in a museum in art in another state.
This weak link helped him get a job there.
That kind of work gave him a reason to leave the boyfriend with the <unk>
Now, five years later, it's <unk> special of events in museums.
This guy with a man who chose <unk>
<unk> his new career, he loves her new family, and send me a letter that said, "Now the room of contacts the emergency room are not sufficiently enough.
<unk> story may sound easy, but that's what I love to work with <unk>
It's very easy to help them.
<unk> are like aircraft coming out of the Los Angeles airport, that come somewhere in the West <unk>
Just before the <unk> a slight fit in its trajectory makes the difference between land in Alaska or in <unk>
Likewise, at the same way, at 21 or even 25 and even <unk> a good conversation, a good TEDTalk -- a good TED Talk can have huge effects over the next years or even the next generation.
Here's my idea worth spreading to all the <unk> <unk>
It's as simple as I learned to tell <unk>
This is what I now have the privilege of telling <unk> like Emma every day: <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> their <unk> get your identity, use your weak ties. You choose to your family.
Don't ever define what they didn't know or what they didn't do.
They're deciding your life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very <unk> job in management management for a job that was even more <unk> <unk>
I went to teach them mathematics in seventh grade in New York schools in New York schools.
And as any teacher, I did test tests and test tests.
I gave them tasks.
When the work came, <unk> <unk>
What was struck by the thing that <unk> was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of those who had a better performance did not have scores of <unk> <unk>
Some of my smartest kids were not doing so well.
And that set me thinking.
The kind of things you need to learn in mathematics in seventh grade, safe, are <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts are not impossible and I was very convinced that every one of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and for enough time.
After several years of <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a <unk> perspective, from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure in better way.
It's the <unk> but what if you succeed in school and life depends on much more than the ability to learn how fast and easy?
So I left the classroom and I went to college to become <unk>
I started studying children and adults in all sorts of <unk> <unk> and in every study my question was, who has success here and why?
My research team and I went to the <unk> <unk> West <unk>
And we tried to predict what we were trying to predict is that military training and who <unk>
We went to the National National <unk> and we tried to predict what children were going as far as possible in competition.
We studied teachers who are working on neighborhoods -- really difficult neighborhoods, which teachers still are going to be teaching for the end of the year of school and <unk> who will be the most effective in improving the learning results.
We teamed up with private companies, asking us what these <unk> are going to hold their <unk>
And who is going to make more money?
In all those different contexts, emerged a feature as a major success of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look, the physical health and it was not <unk>
It was <unk>
<unk> is passion and <unk> to achieve very long-term goals.
<unk> is to have a resistance.
<unk> is clinging to your future, day after day, not just a week, not just for the month, but for years and working hard to make that future a reality.
<unk> is to live life as if it was a <unk> not a career at all speed.
A few years ago, I started studying the determination of the city schools of Chicago.
I asked thousands of high school students to do my <unk> <unk> and then waited about more than a year to see who <unk>
It turns out that children with more determination had significantly greater likely to <unk> even when <unk> on every feature that I could measure, things like family income, the results of <unk> tests, even the security results that children felt when they were in school.
So it's not just in West Point Point or <unk> National <unk> that matters <unk> it's also in school, especially for the children at risk of <unk>
For me, the most powerful thing about determination is how soon we know the science of the development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How to development in children?
What should I do to teach kids a strong job <unk>
How do I keep them driven by the long <unk>
The more honest answer is, I don't know.  What I know is that talent doesn't <unk>
Our data shows very clearly that there are a lot of talented individuals who just don't go ahead with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, the determination commonly is not related to it or it's even related to the <unk>
So far, the best idea I've heard about developing the determination of children is something called <unk> <unk>
This is an idea that was developed at the University of Stanford -- and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not <unk> that it can change the effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and grow in response to the challenge, they're much more likely to <unk> when they <unk> because they don't think that failure is a permanent condition.
So growth growth is a great idea to develop <unk>
But we need more.
And that's where I finish my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have to go.
We need to take our best ideas, our strongest intuitions and we need to <unk>
We need to measure whether they have been successful and we need to be willing to fail, to <unk> to start all again with the lessons <unk>
In other words, we need to be determined about making our kids more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan as the daughter of a <unk> one of my most <unk> memories is my mother, the shape and the shape of the Chinese characters.
Since that time, I was fascinated by this incredible language.
But for a foreigner. It seems like the Great Wall China.
Over the last few years, I've been asking myself if I can break down this <unk> so anyone who wants to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language can do it.
I started thinking about how a new approach and quickly learning Chinese could be helpful.
I started to learn how to draw each of the strokes of every character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Since we only have five minutes, it's better than we do in a faster and simple way.
A Chinese <unk> <unk> 20 characters.
You just need a thousand to understand basic <unk>
The first 200 of them will allow you to understand to understand 40 percent of the basic literature, enough to be able to read traffic traffic signals.
Today I'll start with eight to show you how the method.
Are you ready?
You open your mouth as much as it might be possible until it's <unk>
They get a mouth.
This is a person going to go for a ride.
<unk>
If the shape of fire is a person in both sides, as if I were screaming <unk> I am <unk> I'm <unk> This is actually <unk> of the <unk> but I like to believe it is the other way. The fact that it works.
This is a tree.
tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The symbol of the door looks like a couple of <unk> gates in the old West.
I call these eight characters.
They are building blocks so they create a lot more characters.
One person.
If someone walks back, that's <unk>
As the old said, two are company, three are <unk>
If a person stretch out your arms, this person is saying, <unk> that big.
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
It's a <unk> like <unk> within the whale.
A tree is a tree -- two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a chart under the tree, we have the <unk>
Put a mouth on the tree, that's a <unk> --  <unk> of remember, because a speaker tree is quite an idiot.
Do you remember <unk>
Two <unk> it gets very hot.
Three fireworks together, that's a lot of flames.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two <unk> together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and the moon shining together, that's the <unk>
It also means tomorrow, after one day and a night.
The sun comes out on the horizon.
A door. Put a chart inside the door, it's the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, asking questions.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
This person is coming out of a door, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they're <unk>
Three women together, be careful is <unk>
So we've spent almost 30 characters.
By using this method, the first eight radical <unk> will allow you to build 32.
The next group of eight characters will build some other 32.
So with every little effort, they will be able to learn a couple of hundreds of characters, which is the same thing as a Chinese eight years.
So after knowing the characters, we started creating sentences.
For example, the mountain and fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is the Earth <unk>
This is a sun placed at the beginning, because Japan is in China.
So one sun next to the beginning, we created Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left are two mountains, stacked over the other.
In ancient China, that meant in exile, because Chinese <unk> <unk> their political enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, the exile has become out.
A mouth that tells you to where to go out is a <unk>
This is a slide to remind me that I should stop talking and go down the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be Dad is the movies I get to see.
I love to share my favorite films with my <unk> when my daughter was four years old, we saw the magician <unk> together.
The movie <unk> his imagination for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave him a good excuse to use a brilliant dress and take a magic wand <unk>
But when you see that movie so many times, you get to understand that it's quite remarkable.
We now live and we raise our children in a kind of complex <unk> of child training.
However, the magician magician was an event in itself.
It didn't begin that trend.
This trend really took over 40 years later with, interestingly, another film whose <unk> a guy and a guy named <unk> <unk> a girl dressed as <unk> <unk>
You know what I'm talking about?
There's a big difference between these two films, there are a couple of big differences between the magician <unk> and all the movies we see today.
One is that there are very little violence in the <unk>
The monkeys are quite aggressive, like the <unk>
But I think that if the Oz magician is done today, the magician would say, <unk> you are the salvation of Oz as the self-fulfilling <unk> <unk>
<unk> magic shoes to defeat <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another unique thing about the <unk> of Oz is that the most <unk> characters and even <unk> are women.
I started to notice this when I did see "Star <unk> to my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that time, I also had a son.
It's only three years old.
He wasn't invited by projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the level of supervision had been <unk>  So she was <unk> in the room and was impressed as a mom who had a foot with his <unk> behind, and I didn't think he understood what was happening, but <unk> <unk> everything.
I wonder what <unk>
Would you be <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
I would have a sense that Luke get an army to <unk> the government?
<unk> this with the <unk> Oz magician ...
How do it make it Dorothy his film?
With good <unk> with all of us and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world that I want my children to grow up to <unk> OK?
Why is there so much force of capital <unk> strength in the movies for our children, and so little of the road <unk>
There's a lot of literature on the impact of the <unk> of male violence in the girls, and should be <unk> It's very good.
I haven't read so much about how children react to this encouragement.
I know by experience that the princess princess can't give the proper framework that had been served to navigate the world of adults who is <unk>  I think at the time of the first kiss of the first sentence, I was hoping that the people start to come up because it's the end of the movie, right?
My search is finished, I have <unk>
Why are they standing there?
I don't know what I should do.
The movies are focused on defeat by <unk> and get their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like being a child, you have to be a dumb animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk> suit.
There are so many exceptions, and to defend the Disney <unk> to any of you.
But they send a message to the kids, even though they guys, they're not really their target public.
They do a phenomenal job by teaching girls how to fight the <unk> but don't necessarily show kids how to fight the <unk>
There's no model for them.
We also have some great women that write new stories for our children, so lovely and lovely as <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being movies <unk>
Of course, the most successful issue of all times continues into classic in classic classic <unk> each of them on the adventures of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and his son, or two men who <unk> a young girl.
As many of you are thinking about, this year, eventually came out.
I recommend all of you. It's available in stores.
Do you remember what the criticism said when he came <unk>
I can't believe that Pixar has made a movie of a <unk>
It's very good. Don't let that <unk>
Well, almost none of these films <unk> <unk> test.
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It's still not <unk> and it's still <unk> but maybe we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comic book <unk> and in the <unk> I recorded a conversation that had had with a friend of film assessment that you saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that have to be <unk> in the movie, there are more of a female character who has lines?
So you have to play the <unk>
These women talk to each other at some point in the movie?
Their conversations are about something more besides the kid who are so much like <unk>  All right?  Thank you.  Thank you.
Two women who exist and talk about things each other.
<unk> I've seen, and yet very rarely I see it in the cinema we know and love.
In fact, this week, I went to see a very good quality of a very good quality, <unk>
Right? <unk> of <unk> success is a idea of consensus from what is a real quality of quality.
<unk> is not the test of <unk>
And I don't think that <unk> because a lot of the movie, I don't know if you've seen a lot of the movie -- a lot of the film happens in a embassy where men and women are hidden during the <unk> crisis.
We have a lot of scenes of men who have deep and painful conversations in this <unk> and is the great time for one of the actors, to take a look at the door and say, <unk> the bed, <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So let's go through the numbers.
In 2011, by the 100 <unk> movies how many of them believe that they have <unk>
<unk> It's not bad.
It's not the same percentage of the number of women we've chosen recently to Congress, so it's fine.
But there's a bigger number that this is going to <unk> this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what he said, <unk>
In the United States, one in five women said that it has been sexually <unk> in their lifetime.
I don't think it's the fault of mass entertainment.
I don't think the films for children have something to do with that.
I don't think the music music or pornography are closely <unk> but something is wrong, and when I hear that statistics, one of the things that I think is there is a lot of a lot of sex <unk>
Who are those <unk> What are you <unk>
What do they do not get <unk>
They're <unk> the story that the role of a male hero is to defeat <unk> with violence and then charge the reward, which is a woman who has no friends and not <unk>
We are <unk> that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter as those of you who are doing the same thing, we find this world and this very startling statistic and we want to <unk>
We have tools to our arrangement as <unk> <unk> and we expect that to <unk> but I have to ask, <unk> <unk> will be <unk> if, at the same time, active or <unk> are educating our children to keep their power <unk>
I mean, I think the list of Netflix is a way to do something really important, and here I mean mostly parents.
I think we have to show our children a new definition of <unk>
The definition of <unk> is changing radically.
You've read about how the new economy is changing the role of the home and the <unk>
Everything is changing.
When I asked my daughter what his favorite <unk> character was <unk> You know what <unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What do these two?
Maybe it's not just the brilliant <unk>
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those movies that you know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to help them get their potential.
They're leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want to be less stories that I tell my <unk> Go and struggle and more stories where they see their work is join a team, maybe a team led by women, helping other people to improve and be better people, like the magician <unk>
Thank you.
As a kid, I was living in Maine and one of the things that I liked was I was looking for <unk> on the shores of Maine because my parents told me that I would give me luck.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
It's covered in sand, and it's hard to see them.
However, over time, I was <unk>
I started seeing shapes and patterns that helped me <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in a love for the past and archeology.
And finally, when I started studying <unk> I realized I saw my own eyes wasn't enough.
Because, suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown up to one of about 1,300 miles away along the <unk>
And my seawater cookies had grown to the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite imagery.
To try to make a map of the past, I knew I had to do a different way.
So I want to show you an example of how different you see when we see the <unk>
This is a place located in the eastern <unk> in Egypt called <unk>
And the place of all, it seems to be brown, but when we use the infrared and we process it using fake color, you suddenly see the place that looks like <unk>
What you're looking at are the actual chemical changes of the landscape by building materials and the activities of the ancient Egyptian.
I want to share with you how we've used satellite data to find an ancient <unk> city, called a lost <unk> for thousands of years.
<unk> was the ancient Egypt for over 400 years in a period of time called the Middle <unk> about 4,000 years ago.
The place lies in <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Middle East, there was this great renaissance of ancient art and architecture and religion.
<unk> have always known that <unk> was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that <unk> <unk> inside the red circles here, but somewhere within this huge <unk> <unk>
This area is massive, it's about <unk> by <unk> miles.
Before, I mean, the Nile <unk> right next to <unk> and as it changed over time, I moved to this and covered the entire city.
So how do you find a city <unk> in a <unk> landscape.
And I'll try to find that random would be the equivalent of looking for a needle in a <unk> with the eyes <unk> and using baseball <unk>
So we use data NASA data to make a map of the place, very subtle changes.
We were able to see where the <unk> <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this very high area that looks inside the circle here, which we think could be the location of <unk>
So we collaborated with Egyptians making jobs like <unk> can see it here.
When I say <unk> it's like <unk> <unk> but instead of layers of climate change, we look for layers of human <unk>
Five meters down, under a thick <unk> layer -- we found a dense layer of objects in <unk>
This means that in this possible location of <unk> five feet down, we have a layer of occupation of several hundred years from from the Middle Empire exactly the same period that we think is <unk>
We also found jobs of <unk> <unk> quartz and <unk> which proves that there was a <unk> shop.
This might seem like it's not a lot, but when we think about the most common stones used in charge of the Middle Empire these are the stones that are <unk>
So we have a dense layer of occupation that date from the Middle Empire in this place.
We also have evidence from a elite jewelry shop to prove that what has been there, was a very important city.
We still don't find <unk> here, but <unk> the place in a near future to <unk>
And even more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so they can also perform great discoveries.
I want to end with my favorite quote from the Roman Empire and it was probably written in <unk> 4,000 years ago.
To share knowledge is the biggest of all <unk>
There's nothing like that on land.
So according to the <unk> TED was not founded in 1984 <unk>
Do ideas actually started in 1984 B.C. in a lost city not for a long time and found from the high.
It certainly puts the pursuit of <unk> in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing in front of the door of <unk>
I want you to pay attention to the color of the door, the material that's made.
Now we <unk> a group of obese <unk>
They are competing in a <unk> race race and go back to their front door.
I need you to see this <unk>
They're <unk> strong, they're <unk> they're <unk>
They collide in front of the door of their house.
There is <unk> flying all over the place, wheels that pass on their side, rays of the wheels that end up in places that are <unk> <unk> the threshold of the door.
And so there's the <unk> or what there's on the side of the door, and look at the quality of the light. The light's shining on the <unk> of the <unk>
It's waving with his hand.
From his chair, on a brown horse on the <unk>
It's a horse that's talking about.
You can feel your blue <unk> making them tickle on your nose.
You can smell the <unk> and you get a step in the mouth <unk>
<unk> on one side and trained her living room.
In the room, and making a lot of their imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
It's with little clothes dancing on their middle <unk> singing <unk> <unk> One is <unk>
Now I go to cooking.
The ground has been coated with a yellow <unk> path and from the oven.
Okay. You open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a peculiar contest that takes every spring in New York City.
It's called the <unk> <unk> of the United States."
I was going to cover this event a few years ago as a journalist, <unk> waiting, I guess, this was like the end of a <unk> <unk>
There were several men and a few different <unk> ladies and different habits of hygiene.
They were <unk> hundreds of <unk> numbers just look at them once.
<unk> the names of tens and dozens of strangers.
Let's take full poems in just minutes.
<unk> to see who he could memorize the order of a deck of <unk>
And I was thinking, "This is <unk>
These people must be nature's phenomena.
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This is a man named Ed <unk> who had come from England, and he has one of the best <unk> memories.
I said, <unk> when you realized you were a <unk>
Ed replied, "I'm not a wise.
Actually, I have an average memory.
Everybody who's involved in this competition say that they have normal memory.
"We have been trained to do these miraculous miracle acts using some old techniques invented a half thousand years ago in Greece, the same techniques that we used <unk> to memorize their <unk> and the <unk> academics used to memorize <unk> books.
And my reaction was, <unk> How did I have no idea of this <unk>
We were standing outside of the competition, and <unk> who is a wonderful English and brilliant English, although a little bit <unk> he said, <unk> you're an American journalist.
You meet Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
Because I'd like to teach Britney <unk> how do you memorize the order in a deck of cards in live TV <unk>
That will show you the world that anybody can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me.
I mean, you have to start by something not?"
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.
And I ended up spending most of the next year, not only my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how it works, why it doesn't work and what their potential can be.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man called <unk>
He is <unk> very likely to the worst memory in the world.
His memory was so bad that I didn't even remember it had a problem of <unk> it's awesome.
Somebody incredibly tragic, but it was a window that allowed to see how far our memory makes us who we are.
On the other end of the spectrum I met this man.
This is Kim <unk> He's based on the role of <unk> <unk> in the movie <unk> <unk>
We passed one afternoon in the public library from Salt Lake City, <unk> <unk> <unk> was <unk>
And to come back, a number of treaties on the memory written about 2,000 years ago in Latin, in <unk> and then in the Middle Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time when this idea of having <unk> <unk> and <unk> wasn't a thing as rare as it might look like today.
A long time ago, people invest in their memory, to provide <unk> their minds.
These techniques have made possible our modern world, but they have changed.
We have changed <unk> and I would say that we have changed our own <unk>
As we have almost no need to remember, sometimes it seems to have forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where you are still passionate about this idea of a disciplined and disciplined memory <unk> is this very unique competition of memory.
It's actually not so <unk> there are <unk> like this all over the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a team of researchers from University College in London invited a collection of memory champions to the lab.
They wanted to know, it will be that it has brains in some sense, structural or <unk> different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
Are they more intelligent than the <unk>
They gave it a battery of cognitive test and the answer was actually not.
There was a really interesting and significant difference between the brains of the memory champions and the subjects of control with them.
When they put them on an MRI MRI machine, <unk> your brains while <unk> numbers, faces and forms of <unk> they found that in the memory of the memory of the brain, different parts of the brain, different to others.
In effect, they <unk> or they seemed <unk> a part of the brain that involves spatial memory and navigation.
Why? Is there something we can learn from this?
The tournament of the competitive <unk> is managing as a armed race where each year comes up with a new way of remembering more things, and then the rest of the competitors have to get a day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times of memory.
On his desk, in front of him, there are 36 <unk> <unk> <unk> who's about to try to memorize on an hour, using a technique he invented and just <unk>
He used a similar technique to memorize the bare order of <unk> digits <unk> <unk>
<unk> Yes.
And as there is a lot of ways of remembering things in these <unk> absolutely all the techniques that are reduced to a single concept that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
It is illustrates with a elegant paradox as the <unk> <unk> <unk> says the following. I say to two people who remember the same word -- I say to you, <unk> there's a man called <unk>
That's his <unk>
And then I'm asking you, <unk> there's a <unk> <unk>
And when I go back later, and I asked them to <unk> that word I told you a <unk>
<unk> which <unk>
The person who was told that his name is Baker is unlikely to remember the same word that the person who was told that his job is <unk>
The same word, different capacity of <unk> that's weird.
What happens here?
Well, the name Baker, actually doesn't mean anything for you. It doesn't have any relationship anymore.
With all the other memories that dance on their head.
But the word, <unk> We know <unk>
They wear <unk> <unk>
They have <unk> <unk>
They do well when they come home to work.
Probably <unk> some <unk>
And when we <unk> that word for the first time, we started putting <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> at some time back.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this about two years ago in Greece <unk>
It's known as the <unk> of <unk>
The story says, there was a poet called <unk> who was attending a <unk>
They had hired as a entertainment, because before, if you wanted to give a very good party, you didn't bring a <unk> <unk> to a <unk>
He stood up, <unk> his memory poem and <unk> and as soon as he was left, the classroom <unk> <unk>
<unk> everybody.
But not only killed everybody, but it shattered the bodies to <unk> <unk>
No one could say who was there, no one could remember where they were sitting there.
So they could not be <unk>
A tragedy behind the other.
<unk> standing only removed in the middle of the rubble, closed the eyes and realized that with his eyes in his mind, I could see where I had been sitting every one.
I took the family of the hand <unk> where their loved ones were in the rubble.
What we are going to do is something that we all know more or less <unk> and it is that no matter whether we're not good at remembering names or telephone numbers or instructions for our colleagues, we have visual memory and <unk>
If I let them tell you the first 10 words of the story that I just told you about <unk> is very likely to be very likely to do it.
But I would bet that if you let them tell you who was sitting on the horse who was sitting on the brown creature in his <unk> they would be able to <unk>
The idea of the palace of memory is to create this building with the eyes of your mind and images of images with the things that you want to remember.
This is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago, to the first <unk> <unk> in <unk>
And how does it work?
So let's say you've been invited to the TED stage to give a talk and want to do that by memory in the same way that I would have done it, if you had been invited by <unk> 2,000 years ago.
What you could do is imagine that they're on the door of your house.
And to come up with some kind of an absolute <unk> and crazy image to help them remember that the first thing you want to mention is that completely <unk> competition.
And then you can imagine moving into your house, and see the <unk> of <unk> mounted on Mister <unk>
And that would remind you that you want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you would see Britney <unk> to remind you that funny anecdote that you want to tell.
And then in the kitchen, and the fourth issue that they would talk to be that strange journey that they did for a whole year, and they have some friends to help you remember it.
That's how speakers <unk> <unk> their speakers, not word for word, that is going to confuse it is typical for typical.
In fact, the term <unk> comes from the Greek <unk> which means <unk>
It's a <unk> of when people thought about <unk> and in the rhetoric with this kind of space of space.
The phrase <unk> <unk> would be like the first place in their <unk>
I saw that this was just fascinating, and I got into that.
I went to some of these memory skills, and I had the idea of writing a big thing about this <unk> of <unk> <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is a <unk> event.
I mean, really, it's like seeing a lot of people sitting at <unk> I mean, the most exciting thing that happens is when someone gets <unk> in front of it.
I'm a journalist and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are amazing things happening in the minds of these people, but I don't have access.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put myself in place.
So I started spending 15 or 20 minutes every morning, before I sit down to see the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an ancient <unk> school bought in a <unk> market.
And I discovered this was kind of fun.
I would never have expected you to do it.
It was fun, because it wasn't just about training the memory.
What it's really about to do is improve more and more the ability to create and imagine these images that are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of the mind.
It was pretty much like this.
This is me, using my standard training team for memory competition.
It's a couple of <unk> and some security glasses covered with tape leaving only two <unk> because the distraction is the worst enemy of a memory <unk>
And I ended up coming back to the same contest that he had covered a year before, and I had the idea that it could be <unk> in a kind of <unk> experiment.
I thought this could serve for good <unk> for my whole research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the <unk> something that didn't have to happen.
Of course, it's cute being able to memorize speeches and phone numbers, and <unk> <unk> but actually this is not the point.
These are just <unk> tricks.
Because they're based on the very basic principles of how the brain works.
And you don't need to be building <unk> of memory or memorize <unk> from <unk> to benefit from a little bit of insights about how their mind.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was about a gift <unk> but it's not the case.
The big memories <unk>
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
<unk> when we focus on deeply.
The palace of <unk> these memory techniques, are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even <unk>
They work because they make us <unk>
It <unk> a kind of deep processing -- a kind of complete attention that most of us are not walking around there.
But the reality is that there are no shortcuts.
That's how things do <unk>
And if there is something that I want to leave you with today, is what I <unk> the <unk> that I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, and I left me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose what is our short <unk> existence in <unk> or <unk> not by paying attention to the human being in front of us, who walks our side -- we will be so <unk> that we are not even <unk> in <unk>
I learned from the first hand that there's incredible memory capabilities on all of us.
But if you want to live a <unk> life, you must be the kind of person that remembers remember.
Thank you.
Today I'm going to talk to you about the last 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex issue, so I just <unk> just a <unk> place, New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I'm from <unk> <unk> I was six years old, and I lived there in my parents' home in a village called <unk> and this was my bedroom.
In the corner, from my bedroom, I was the bathroom I shared with my sister.
And between my bedroom and the bathroom, there was a balcony that I gave the living room.
And you all spent time watching TV, and so every time I went from my room to the bathroom, everyone looked at me, and every time I <unk> and I would come back and wrapped up in a towel and I all saw me.
And I was like this.
It was <unk> <unk> and hated it.
I <unk> that tour, hated that <unk> hated that room and that house.
That's the architecture.
All right.
Those feelings, those emotions that I felt, that is the power of architecture, because architecture is not about math, and of <unk> division but of those connections, emotional connections, we feel in the places that we <unk>
And it's no wonder that we feel like that way, because according to the Environmental Protection Agency -- the Americans spend 90 percent of their time under roof.
I mean, 90 percent of the time are surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
Architecture determines us in ways we don't even notice it.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
That means that when I show you a building like this, I know what they <unk> you think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know they think about it because of a building that's built a half thousand years ago by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> that architects use to create an emotional connection to the ways that we build our buildings.
It's an emotional connection -- <unk> we've used this trick for a very, very long time.
We use it 200 years ago to build banks.
We use it in the 19th century to build art <unk>
And in the 20th century in America, we use it to build homes.
Look, these <unk> stable, <unk> in front of the sea, away from the elements.
This is very, very useful, because building things is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a long time and it's very complicated.
The people who <unk> <unk> and governments, are always afraid to innovation, and they prefer to use ways they know they're going to work.
So we found ourselves with buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
This is the <unk> Public Library of <unk> which was in 2004, in my hometown, and, you know, has a <unk> has this round thing -- columns, red brick -- that <unk> what <unk> is trying to communicate with this <unk> kids, the values of property -- the values of property values history.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library in today.
That same year, in 2004, on the other side of the country, became another library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use media in the digital era.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to come together, read and share.
So how is it possible that in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, two buildings, they're so completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works on the beginning of the <unk>
On one side is <unk> architects constantly drive new technologies, new <unk> new solutions to the living forms of life forms today.
We were just going to put it together and put it so much, that we get out of the people.
All of the black -- this is <unk> you think we feel good, but we're going to be dead because we have no other choice.
We need to go on the other side and come back to connect with those symbols that are <unk>
So we are all happy, and we're all happy, but we feel like <unk> So we start to experience <unk> we're going to swing the next door to go ahead and over and over again. So we've done it over the last 300 years, and of course it is, in the last 300 years.
Well, 30 years ago I was in the '70s.
The architects were busy experimenting with the so-called <unk>
It has to do with concrete.
So you can guess.
<unk> small <unk> <unk>
Something really hard.
So we're approaching the '80s, and we started to incorporate those symbols.
<unk> the next thing in the other direction.
We take those forms that we know that like and the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we add a <unk> and we use new materials.
They love it.
We don't give <unk>
We take <unk> <unk> and we made them in skyscraper, that they can be <unk>
The shapes are <unk> they won in boldness and <unk>
<unk> became columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
<unk>
But it was the 1980s, that was great.
We all spent the time in business centers, we moved to the neighborhoods, and in the suburbs, we could create our own erotic <unk>
Those fantasies could be <unk> to French or <unk>
Maybe with a <unk> of bread.
This is what happens to the <unk>
This is what happens to the symbols.
They're easy, they're cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, we <unk> memories of other places.
I know very well, and you all know, this is not the <unk>
This is Ohio.
Architects feel frustrated and began to swing the next thing again in the other direction.
In the '80s and early '90s, we start to experiment with the so-called <unk>
<unk> the symbols of <unk> now we have new design techniques, and we find new <unk> some ways that were <unk> against other forms.
This is academic and <unk> and it's super <unk> You get totally <unk>
Normally the <unk> <unk> in the opposite direction.
But then, something else happened.
In 1997, it opened this building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building changed fundamentally the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when <unk> and public and general public, they were completely <unk> about a building.
The New York Times <unk> this <unk>
<unk> in Bilbao grew up on a half thousand percent when they finished the building.
So all of a sudden, everybody wanted one of those <unk> L.A., in Seattle, Chicago, New York, Cleveland, <unk>
Everybody wanted one, and Gehry was everywhere.
He was our first star.
But how is it possible that these wild forms, and <unk> how is it possible to become ubiquitous around the world?
And it happened, because media <unk> around them, and we quickly learned that those shapes meant, and tourism.
We've created an emotional reaction with these forms.
The same thing did the first mayors in the world.
So everybody believed that if they had these forms, they had culture and tourism.
This phenomenon of the new millennials went with other <unk>
He went to <unk> and <unk> and what happened with these few elite architects on the threshold of the new millennium, actually began to happen with all of the architecture.
Think for example, how do we use architecture.
A thousand years ago, they would have to have walked to the next town to see a building.
<unk> <unk> can take a ship, a plane, can be <unk>
<unk> technology, you can see in the newspapers, on TV, and in the end, we're all photographers of architecture, and the building is more beyond its physical location.
The architecture is everywhere, that means that the communications speed has finally reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture moves so quickly.
It doesn't take a long time to think about a building.
It takes a lot of time to build a building, three or four years, and at that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 more buildings, before we knew if which I designed four years ago was a success or not.
Because there has never been good feedback in architecture.
That's how we find buildings like this.
The <unk> was not a <unk> movement but 20 years.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much <unk>
That's never going to be <unk> because we're at the threshold of the largest revolution in architecture from the invention of the <unk> of steel or <unk> and it's the media revolution.
My theory is that when you apply the <unk> to media, it starts to swing increasingly fast, until you get to be on both extremes almost in <unk> and actually <unk> the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, the architects, and you, the public.
Now we can make symbols almost <unk> with emotional <unk> of something completely new.
I'll show you how the system works in a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> in <unk> Island, in the state of New York.
It's a vacation.
But that meant two years before the building, was already part of the community, and as the drawings looked like exactly the <unk> finished, there was no surprises.
The building came to be part of the community that first summer, when people began to get and shared it in social media, the building stopped being a building, because these are not just a building, because these are not just images of a building, because these are not just images of a building, are the images that one of the building.
And as you use it to tell their story, they become part of personal narrative, and it makes <unk> with collective memory, and when you carry these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks to tell us how to think of architecture.
We can tell each other where we think of architecture, because digital media has not only changed the relationship between us, but have changed the relationship between us and the buildings.
Think about a second in those librarians of <unk>
If that building was built today, first <unk> on the Internet for <unk> <unk>
<unk> bombarded with examples of <unk> of innovation, what a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that you can take the mayor of <unk> to <unk> people and tell them that there's no unique answer to what a library can be today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions is the freedom of experience.
Everything is different now.
Architects are no longer these mysterious creatures that use <unk> words and <unk> and you are no longer a <unk> audience, who don't have seen anything that I haven't seen before.
The architects can listen, and you don't leave <unk> by architecture.
That means that the pendulum <unk> of one style to another, of a movement to another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find right solutions to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the history of architecture, and it means that the buildings in the morning will be very different from the buildings today.
That means that a public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be unique and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad imitation of red brick based on the basis of what was a <unk>
That means that some robots can build our buildings, because we will finally be ready for the ways that are going to produce.
That means that buildings are <unk> to the whims of nature and not the opposite.
This means that a parking parking lot in <unk> Beach, Florida, also can serve to do sports or <unk> or even one can get married there at night.
That means three architects can dream with swimming in the East <unk> East <unk> and raising half a million dollars of the <unk> community around that cause, no longer a client alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little pavilion of <unk> so <unk> and <unk> like the animals that are going to observe.
Because no matter whether it's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built, which matters is what we build.
The architects already know how to make more <unk> and more <unk>
We've been waiting for everyone to want.
Finally, we're not on opposite sides anymore.
Find an architect, <unk> and <unk> together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot of play.
Buildings are not just reflecting our society, but they give way to the <unk> spaces, the local libraries the homes where we form our children, and the <unk> in the bathroom.
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just turned a year and started walking.
And it does it in the very typical way of the children of a year, <unk> as if their body was moving too fast for his legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that you like to do is look for the mirror.
She really loves his <unk>
<unk> and <unk> and it gives themselves these big kisses big and <unk>
It's beautiful.
Apparently, all of your friends do this and my mom tells me that I used to do it, and made me think, When do I stop doing this?
How is that that we suddenly aren't comfortable with our <unk>
Because, apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people are looking for the word, "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> it's 13 and lives in <unk>
And as any teenager just wants to be loved and fit in.
It's Sunday night.
It's preparing for next week in school.
It's got a little bit confused because even though his mom says all the time she's beautiful, every day in school, someone tells you it's ugly.
The thing that his mom says and what his friends, or <unk> they say, doesn't know who I believe.
So a video of her himself, he publishes it on YouTube, and he calls others who please leave a <unk> "I'm a nice or I'm <unk>
Well, until now, <unk> has received over 13,000 comments.
Some of these are so <unk> that it doesn't even deserve to think about them.
We talked about a healthy and normal teenager who receives these answers on one of the stages of their most emotionally vulnerable.
Thousands of people are posting videos like this, mostly teenage girls trying to communicate this way.
But what's going to do this?
Well, the teenagers today almost never alone.
They're under pressure from being online and available all the time, talking about, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- this is never over.
Never before we've been so connected, it's a continuous way, so young <unk>
As a mother told me, "It's like there's a party in your room all the <unk>
There's simply no privacy.
And the social pressures that come from hand with that are <unk>
This environment, of being always connected, is <unk> our children to <unk> based on the number of likes that they have and the kinds of comments that they do.
There's no division between a life in line and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what's real or what it isn't.
And also, it's very hard to know the difference between what is authentic and what is <unk> digitally.
What is the most important thing in someone's life in front of what is normal in a daily context.
And where are they looking for <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> from the news of girls now.
<unk> <unk> remain <unk>
<unk> technique is now routine.
And trends are like, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those who <unk> <unk> means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in popular culture today.
It's not hard to see what young people are.
But kids are also not immune to this.
Like the <unk> stars of sport, and folk singers.
But what is the problem with all this?
Well, we certainly want our children to grow healthy and be <unk> individuals.
But in a <unk> culture, we're teaching our children to spend more time and mental effort on their appearance, at the price of all other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical skills, their studies and other ways they start to hurt.
Six in 10 girls want to do something because they think they don't see good enough.
These are not <unk> activities.
They're fundamental activities for their growth as human beings, and as <unk> to society and the field of labor development.
31 percent, almost one in three teenagers are not interested in the discussions of class. <unk> to participate in the classroom <unk> because they don't want to call care of their physical <unk>
One out of five aren't attending classes at all during the days when they're not comfortable about it.
And in the <unk> season, if you don't think you see good enough, specifically if you don't think you're creative, <unk> <unk> a minor note to the average of your fellow people who don't care about what it looks like.
And this phenomenon has been widespread in Finland, America and China.
And it turns out independently of what these young people are.
So to be very clear, we're talking about you -- not how you see you.
The low self-esteem of your body is <unk> the academic performance.
And it's also <unk> health.
<unk> with little self-esteem are doing less physical activity, they eat less fruit and vegetables, <unk> in more diet not healthy that can lead them to a food disorder,
They have low self-esteem.
They're more easily <unk> by the people around you and are at greatest risk of depression.
And we think it's all about this because of what they make more <unk> decisions like the consumption of alcohol and drugs, diet <unk> <unk> sexual activity, and no protection and damage <unk>
The pursuit of the perfect body is pushing into the healthcare system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women are <unk> again, regardless of whether or they have no higher rates of <unk>
The 17 percent of women don't present to a job interview in a day where they don't feel secure with the way they see.
Think about a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would be that <unk>
<unk> this potential is in interest for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking, it doesn't take you too far.
It's not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key <unk> The first is that we have to instill trust in their own body.
We need to help our teenagers develop strategies to overcome the pressure of the perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are a lot of programs available to do it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was very surprised when I learned that a lot of <unk> programs didn't realize -- I would have the situation.
So we have to make sure that the program that we're following our children will not only have a positive impact, but also a <unk> impact.
And research studies show that the best programs focus on six key areas, the first one is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six ways are critical points for anyone willing to provide education in body self-esteem that works.
One education is a fundamental thing, but to address this problem requires each of us to take charge in the issue and be a better model to follow women and girls in our own lives.
challenging the current status of how women are seen and talked about our circles.
It's not good to count with the input of our politicians in <unk> or the size of your <unk> or the size of your <unk> or the size of the <unk> <unk> depends on the fact that it's not a great beauty.
We need to start judge people by what they are, not because they see them.
We all can start by taking responsibility for the kind of images and the comments that we published in our social networks.
We can <unk> people based on their effort and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you here? When was the last time you put a <unk>
In short, we need to work together as communities, as governments and as businesses, to truly change our culture, so that our children will grow to valuing their entire person, valuing individuality, diversity, <unk> diversity, <unk>
We need to put people who are actually making the difference in a <unk>
So make a difference in the real world, let's make them the ones that come out on the big screen because we just create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they think they are never seen as they are who they are, or to reach their lives.
Think of what this can mean for someone in their lives.
Who has in mind?
<unk>
<unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk>
It could just be simply the woman who's at two seats away. What would it mean for her if he was liberated from that voice <unk> in his interior, he was <unk> by not having long legs, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
What would it mean for her if we <unk> this and make their potential in that way?
Right now, the obsession with our culture with the images are <unk> us all.
But let's take our children the truth.
You know, the way you see you are just a part of your identity, and the truth is that we love them for those who are and what they do, and because they make us feel.
They brought the self-esteem in the <unk> of our schools.
So let's change each of us, the way we talk about and compared to other people.
And <unk> together as a community from small groups to governments, so that small <unk> of a year of today, become in agents of insurance change from themselves tomorrow.
So let's do it.
On November five of the 1990s, a gentleman named <unk> <unk> walked into a hotel in Manhattan and killed the rabbi, <unk> <unk> the leader of the League of Defense <unk>
As soon as they were initially considered innocent -- but being prisoner for other young charges in company, they started planning attacks at about 12 <unk> in New York, including <unk> <unk> and the United Nations.
Fortunately, those plans <unk> by an informant in the FBI.
Sadly, the bomb bomb in the World Trade Center couldn't be <unk>
Later on, he would be convicted of their participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being an engineer <unk> with a loving American <unk> a high school school school teacher made everything possible for me a happy childhood, for me.
Only when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My dad taught me a way of Islam, that very few, even most Muslims get to meet.
I saw that when people take time to interact with, they don't need a lot to want to wish the same things in life.
However, in all of the human group, in all human group, there are always a tiny fraction of people who were <unk> so <unk> to their convictions that thinks that we have to use all the possible media for everyone to live like them.
A few months before arrest he sat with me and explained to me that in the weekends, and he explained to me that in the weekends, he and some friends, had been going to throw on Long Island to practice practice.
He told me that I would go with him the next day.
We got to the <unk> <unk> <unk> which, without knowing our group, was <unk> by the FBI.
When I got <unk> my father helped me hold the <unk> on my shoulder, and explained to me how to aim for about 30 meters.
And that day, with the last bullet I shot at the little orange light on the goal and to surprise everybody, especially me, all the goal broke on fire.
My uncle turned to the other and Arabic, said <unk> <unk>
As father, as a child.
All of all, the comment produced a lot of laughter. But just a few years later I understood what they were so funny.
You saw in me, the same level of destruction that my father could <unk>
Those people later would be <unk> by putting a <unk> <unk> with 700 pounds of explosives in the underground tower in the World Trade Center, causing a explosion that killed six people and injured other 1,000.
I admired those men.
He called them <unk> which means uncle.
When I was 19, I had been moved by 20 times. That instability during my childhood, not allowed me to do a lot of <unk>
Every time I started to feel comfortable about somebody is time to pack and go to another city.
As long as I was always a new face of the class was often <unk>
<unk> secret is my identity to avoid being the white one, silent and <unk> was enough <unk>
So most of the time I'm going to go home reading books, watching television or playing video games.
For these reasons it didn't have a social skills, it didn't develop social skills, to put it very <unk> and I was not prepared for the real world.
I would say, <unk> to judge people, based on <unk> indicators like their race or their religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that they put to test my thinking was during the presidential election of 2000.
In a <unk> program where I was involved in the <unk> National Convention in Philadelphia.
My group was <unk> in the subject of juvenile violence, as I had been victim of <unk> almost all my life, was something that I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from various <unk>
One day, at the end of the <unk> I discovered that one of the kids had <unk> was Jewish as Jewish people.
I took a number of days to go out to light this detail and realized that there was no <unk> between the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend, and I was really proud to have been able to overcome the barrier that all life had been made to be <unk>
Another crucial moment came out when I got a summer work in Bush <unk> a <unk> park.
I found myself with people of all kinds of beliefs and cultures. That experience was fundamental to the development of my character.
All of the life had taught me that <unk> was a sin and by extension, all gay men were bad <unk>
I happened to have the opportunity to work with gay actors there, in a show, and I could see that several of them were the <unk> and less critics that I had seen in life.
Having been a little bit of a child, I developed a sense of empathy to the suffering of others. But it wasn't easy for me to treat people, exactly the way I wish I would be treated.
So that feeling was able to contrast the stereotypes that had taught me as a child, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know what that is being homosexual but I know what is being judged by something beyond my control.
And then came the <unk> <unk>
All night, Jon Stewart made me become honest about my <unk> and helped me see that the race of people, religion or sexual orientation, has nothing to do with character.
In many ways he became my <unk> <unk> at a moment where I was desperately <unk>
Sometimes inspiration can come from the unexpected. And that a Jewish comedian would have had a better influence in my life than my own father, <unk> was not in vain.
One day I had a conversation with my mother about how I was changing my thinking, and she told me something that I keep in my heart forever, while he's alive.
She looked at me with the eyes tired of someone who has suffered enough <unk> and said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that time, I realized how much negative energy you need to keep all of that hatred inside.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why decided to go out and put myself in a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because I hope that someone, one day, who is trying to take violence, I can hear my story and understand that there is a better way to do, but even though I get to this violent ideology and <unk> I didn't get to make me <unk>
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and against <unk>
I do it by the victims of terrorism and their loved ones, and for the terrible pain and the losses that terrorism has produced in their lives.
For the victims of the terrorism victims, we talk against those <unk> acts of sense, like rejection of my father.
Now with this <unk> I'm just showing that violence is not inherent to no religion or race, that children don't have to follow their parents' roads.
I'm not my father.
Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.
At this point, there's a film that has been involved in your minds.
It's an incredible <unk>
It's in 3D and has <unk> sound of what you hear and see right now, but that's just the beginning.
Your film has smell, taste and texture.
It feels your body, your pain, your <unk>
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memories, as a moments of your childhood project in front of your eyes.
And it's constantly a voice superimposed on your flow of conscious thinking.
The heart of the movie are you who experience all the live.
This film is your flow of consciousness, the subject of the experience of the mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths about the existence of being human.
Each of us are conscious.
We all have an open film, you, you and you.
There is nothing that we make more directly.
At least, I know I have an <unk>
I don't know that you're aware of you.
Consciousness is also the reason to live.
If we were not aware of anything in our lives it would make sense or value.
But at the same time it's the most mysterious phenomenon of the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these films <unk>
Why are we not just robots that are <unk> what we get to produce results without experiencing the movie <unk>
Right now, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate consciousness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible to be a science of consciousness.
The science, by nature, is objective target.
<unk> by nature, is subjective <unk>
So there can never be a science of consciousness.
Because for most of the 20th century, we <unk> that vision.
Psychology is studying behavioral behavior, neuroscience is studying the <unk> brain, but no one mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED started, there were very few scientific jobs on consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, everything began to change.
<unk> like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> said, <unk> is the time for science <unk> <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, a <unk> of the scientific work on consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental limits to the time.
The center of the science of consciousness in recent years was the pursuit of <unk> correlations between some of the brain areas and some states of consciousness.
We saw some of this kind of great work that I produced Nancy <unk> a few minutes ago.
Now we understand much better, for example, the areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience of seeing faces or feeling pain or feeling happy.
But this is still a science of <unk>
It's not a science of explanations science.
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of conscious experiences, but we don't know why.
I'd like to explain by saying that this kind of work is really answering some questions that we want to explain consciousness. The questions about what certain areas of the brain do and what they are <unk>
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
I don't offend the <unk>
There isn't really easy problems with consciousness.
Well, it doesn't address the real <unk> mystery of this <unk> Why all the physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is there an internal movie <unk>
Right now, we can't understand it.
And you can say, let's give it a few years to the neuroscience.
It's going to turn into another emerging phenomenon, like <unk> like life, and we're going to find explanation.
The typical <unk> are all cases of emergent behaviors, how do we operate <unk> how <unk> work -- how <unk> are <unk> and <unk> the living organisms are all questions about how it works.
That could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and functions of the human brain as a <unk> phenomenon, how we speak, how we speak, how we talk to <unk> all of them are questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions about behavior are among easy problems.
But the hard problem is the question of why it is that everything is accompanied by an <unk> experience.
And here it is, the standard paradigm of <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, actually doesn't have a lot to say.
I am a <unk>
I want a scientific theory of the <unk> that it works. For a long time, I was hitting the head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pure physical terms that would work.
But at the end I came to the conclusion that that was not working for <unk> reasons.
I think we will stand up at this point.
We have a very wonderful, cool explanations chain, we get used to this; the physics explains chemistry, chemistry explains biology, biology explains part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit into this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we are conscious.
We don't know how to accommodate that idea to our scientific vision of the world.
I think the consciousness, right now is a kind of <unk> something that we need to integrate our worldview, but we don't know still how.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need ideas that are <unk> mad, before we can deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There's some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today has one.
His crazy idea is that there is no hard problem of consciousness.
The whole idea of the subjective movie includes a kind of illusion or confusion.
Actually, what you've got to do, is to explain the functions of the brain behaviors -- the behaviors of the brain. And so you study everything that needs explanation.
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of consciousness -- purely <unk> based on the brain.
At the same time, for me and many others, that vision is quite close to simply deny that the observation of consciousness is <unk>
But I go in a different direction.
In the time, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is fundamental.
<unk> sometimes take some aspects of the universe as <unk> <unk> space, time and mass.
<unk> <unk> laws like the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These laws and fundamental properties don't explain in terms of anything more basic.
Instead, they consider fundamental principles, and that's where the world is constructed.
Sometimes the list of the fundamental list is <unk>
In the 19th century, <unk> found that you can't explain the electromagnetic phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts <unk> space, <unk> time, <unk> law, the basic laws of <unk> And he applied the electrical charge as a fundamental concept that those laws <unk>
I think that's the situation we find with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas that are going to grow space, and time, mass, <unk> <unk> then for the question of logic, you have to add the list.
The most natural thing would be <unk> consciousness as something fundamental -- a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that suddenly it's not the object of science.
It opens the path to <unk> scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect consciousness with other fundamental concepts space, the space -- the mass, physical processes.
<unk> sometimes say we want to be fundamental laws that we can put them into a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find very simple laws that we can put in a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what we need.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Every system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> for all, <unk> in mind, every system is conscious not only humans -- the dogs, the dogs, flies, even the microbes of Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be filled with anxiety when they think of my <unk> always traveling at the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, no.
But thinking is that maybe photons can be able to have some kind of crude feeling, <unk> some of the early <unk> of consciousness.
This may sound a little bit crazy for you.
How would anybody think something so <unk>
Part of this comes from the first crazy idea, consciousness is a fundamental thing.
If it's fundamental to space, the time and the mass, it's natural to assume that it can also be universal, just like others.
It's also worth noticing that even though the idea is <unk> it's much less for people in different cultures, where the human mind seems more a continuum of nature.
A deeper reason comes from the idea that perhaps the most simple and powerful form of finding fundamental laws that we make, the thinking with the physical process, is <unk> consciousness with information.
Whenever there's information processing -- there is awareness.
<unk> of complex <unk> as in a human being, an complex.
<unk> simple information, simple awareness.
So something very exciting is that in recent years a neuroscientist, a neuroscientist, <unk> took this kind of theory and developed <unk> with mathematical methods.
It has a natural measure of information integration which is called <unk> which measures the degree of information integrated into a system.
And it's supposed to be <unk> it has to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of <unk> of information, a high degree of <unk> a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there is a kind of kind of information integration -- just a significant amount of information, degree of conscious awareness.
But when you get to the worms, microbes, particles, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of information integration is smaller, but it's not zero either.
In <unk> theory, there will still be a level of conscious consciousness of zero.
In fact, <unk> a fundamental law of <unk> high degree of consciousness.
Moreover, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate consciousness into the physical world.
<unk> and philosophers have often observed that physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but it's not talking about the reality behind the reality behind the underlying reality behind us.
As explains Stephen Hawking, "Where is the fire <unk>
From <unk> vision, the equations of physics can leave as they are, but you can use to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, consciousness is the one that puts fire in equations.
In that vision, consciousness doesn't find out of the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's right there in the center.
This vision, I think, <unk> vision has the potential to <unk> our relationship to nature, and it can have a fairly serious ethical and ethical <unk>
Some can be <unk>
I used to think that I didn't have to eat anything that had consciousness, so I had to be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you accept that vision, you'll get a lot hungry.
I think thinking about it, this tends to transform your <unk> while what matters in ethical terms and <unk> is not both the fact of consciousness, but its importance and complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system of Samantha <unk> <unk>
It's <unk>
According to the vision of <unk> information, she has a complicated information processing so that the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
If this is right, they are given some pretty serious ethical problems about the ethic of the development of smart computers and the ethics ethic.
And finally, you can ask for the consciousness of <unk> the planet.
Canada has its own consciousness?
Or a more local level, an integrated group, like the audience at a TED Talk, we have a collective TED <unk> an inner movie for this whole group of TED, different from the inner movies from each of the <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least it's a question you have to take seriously.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical vision, and I don't know if it's correct.
I'm actually safer of the first crazy idea that consciousness is something fundamental than the second, which is universal.
The vision raises a lot of questions, so many challenges, like, how do those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex consciousness we know and love us.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we go through the right way to a theory of serious awareness.
If not, well, this is probably the hardest problem for science and philosophy.
We can't wait to solve it at night to the morning.
But I think we ultimately will be discovered.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the right idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a small village in rural Victoria.
I had a very normal profile, a under education.
I went to school, I was obsessed with my friends, <unk> me with my younger sisters.
Everything was very normal.
And when I was 15 years old, a member of my community came up to my parents because I wanted to <unk> for a community award for the community.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice, but there's a gay problem.
She has actually never gotten nothing."
I went to school, I had good grades. After school, I had a <unk> <unk> in my mother, and I spent a lot of time looking at the <unk> series the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yeah, I know. What a contradiction.
But they were right.
I did nothing that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing that can be considered as a achievement if we took disability outside the equation.
Some years later, I was in the second part of the teaching in a high school school, just after about 20 minutes in the <unk> class of studies -- a guy raised his hand and said, "Hey, when to give your <unk>
I said, "What is <unk>
Well, I had been talking about the law of <unk> for good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your <unk> speech.
When people in chairs of wheels, they talk about <unk> things at school?"
<unk> in the <unk> room.
And it was then when I realized, this is a child who had had experiences with people with disability as objects of inspiration.
And we don't know, and it's not the fault of the boy, it's true for many of us.
For us, people with disability are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We're not real people. We're there to inspire us.
And in fact, I'm on this stage <unk> what I do in this chair of wheels, and you're probably waiting for you, right?  Yes.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid <unk> <unk>
I'm not here for <unk>
I'm here to tell you that we have lied to disability.
Yes, you have sold the lie that disability is something <unk> A capital <unk>
It's something bad and living with a disability makes you remarkable.
It's not something bad and can't make you remarkable.
And over the last few years, we've been able to spread even more this lie through social media.
You may have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> "Your excuse is <unk>
Or this <unk> "Before <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there is a lot of them.
It may have seen one of the girl with no hands drawing with a pencil held by the mouth.
You may have seen a child running with <unk> legs.
And there's a lot of these images, which is what we call <unk> <unk>
And I use the term porn term -- because we <unk> a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, we will <unk> those people in the benefit of people without disabilities.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so we could see them and say, "Well, for very bad that it is my life, it could be worse.
I could be that person.
But if you're that person?
I've lost the number of times the number of times they've been approached by strangers who believe that I am brave or an source of inspiration, and this will happen to before my work had a public profile.
It was like me getting up in the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
These images, those images, those images are inspired by people with disability for people without disabilities.
They're there so you can see them and think that things are not as bad for you, or to put their concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually a hard thing.
So let's get a few things.
But the things that we <unk> are not the things that you can think of.
They're not relative to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> deliberately because I joined the so-called social model of disabilities, which tells us that we're more likely because of the society that we live in because of our bodies or diagnostics.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very <unk> with him.
It makes the things that I need to do, and I've learned to pull the best out of your ability as you do, and that's what happens to the children of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything outside the common.
They are simply using their bodies taking the best of their ability.
So, it's really fair <unk> in the way we do that, when we share those <unk>
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> it tells you how a compliment.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of the lie, because they have sold us this lie that disability makes us quite remarkable.
And honestly, it doesn't do.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here <unk> the inspiration, and you think, "My God, you're not sometimes inspired by anything?"
And actually, I know I am.
<unk> from other people with disability at all time.
However, I don't know that I'm happier than them.
<unk> that is a great idea to use <unk> <unk> to pick up the things that fall over.  <unk> the ingenious trick of how to charge the battery on the mobile phone in the <unk>
Great.
We learn from force and resistance of others, not against our bodies and our <unk> but against a world that <unk> and <unk>
I really believe that that lie that we've been sold about disability is the biggest <unk>
It makes us hard life.
And that quote: "The only disability in life is bad <unk> the reason that that's lie is because it's not true because of the social model of disabilities.
A lot of smiles before a stairs drum has never done to become a <unk>
Never.   <unk> to a television screen will not go to the <unk> for the <unk> people.
Not a lot of people in the middle of a <unk> and <unk> a positive attitude to turn all those books into the <unk>
It's simply not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where disability is not the exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15 year-old girl sitting in his bedroom watching <unk> the <unk> <unk> don't be considered to be <unk> of nothing for being in a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have so low expectations of people who are challenged to be <unk> by getting off the bed and remember our names in the morning.
I want to live in a world where the genuine achievement of people with disabilities, and I want to live in a world where a child of the 11 degree in a high school in Melbourne is not a little surprised that his new teacher is a <unk> <unk>
<unk> doesn't make us <unk> but question what you think you know about what you do.
Thank you.
What do you have to do is augmented reality and professional football with the <unk>
And what is the average speed of a <unk> <unk>
Unfortunately, today just answer one of those questions, so please don't get <unk>
When people think of it actually <unk> they think about <unk> <unk> and Tom <unk> <unk> the hands in the air, but the augmented reality is not science fiction.
<unk> reality is something that will happen in our days and happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to learn, because reality reality will change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how did we get to the reality of <unk>
The first step, is what I'm wearing the Google <unk> glasses.
I'm sure many of you are familiar with them.
What you may not know is that Google <unk> are a device that allows you to see what I see.
It will allow you to experience what is being a professional <unk> in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I try to <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you will engage with your imagination.
We can use Google Glass, under a helmet and know what is running through the game field to 160 <unk> the blood hitting the ears.
We can know that one man feels like a man 110 pounds <unk> we were trying to <unk> with all of us being.
I've been there and I assure you that it's not nice.
So I put some videos to show you what is to use Google <unk> under the hull, and give you an idea of that.
Unfortunately, it's not images of <unk> practices because the idea of the emerging technology is a submarine moving up to the surface. But we do what we can.
So let's look at a video.
Chris <unk> Come on.
It's horrible to be <unk>
A moment. <unk> a little bit.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what is being <unk> in the football field, from the perspective of the <unk>
You may have realized that we need people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, <unk> from the University of Washington.
<unk> of <unk> mice. <unk> mice.
Blue 8, Blue <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more like feeling in the field, but it has nothing to do with being in the <unk>
<unk> want that experience.
The fans want to be in the field, to be their favorite players and have asked me on YouTube and in <unk> <unk> can see from the angle of a field <unk>
or <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how we get in <unk> how we take it to the next <unk>
We took it to that level using something called <unk> <unk> which probably many people already know.
The Rift <unk> has been described as the most realistic virtual reality apparatus ever created, and it's not cheap.
And I'm going to show you why this is this video.
Man: Oh, <unk>
No, no, no! I don't want to follow <unk> No!
Oh, my God!
<unk> That's the experience of a man on a mountain Russian roller <unk> for his life.
What is the experience of a fan of a fan of a fan of a fan of Adrian <unk> across the line, <unk> of a <unk> with the arm before and run a <unk> What's the experience of a fan experience.
When he can be <unk> running by the <unk> launching the ball back to the bottom of the network?  Or <unk> doing a <unk> in <unk>
What is their experience when you walk from a mountain to more than 100 miles an hour like a <unk> <unk>
Maybe the <unk> of diapers for adults.
But this is not really <unk>
It's just virtual reality, <unk>
How do we get the reality of <unk> <unk>
<unk> augmented reality when <unk> <unk> and owners see the information that people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use technology to win.
They like to win. They give them money.
So, here's a quick refresher on technology in <unk>
In <unk> the Baltimore <unk> had a <unk> to his field <unk> so he played faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to <unk>
More people saw the party because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the <unk> put <unk> in the field of <unk> and after the <unk>
They had more viewers because it was faster, more entertaining.
In <unk> imagine that you're a player going back to your group, and you see your next group you are shown in front of you, in a plastic bombsight that you wear -- no longer -- you won't have to worry about a <unk>
<unk> the strategy.
They just go out to the field and <unk>
And the coaches want it because if you don't follow their instructions, they lose parties, they hate <unk>
If you lose parties -- like a coach.
And they don't want that.
But augmented reality is not just a manual of <unk> strategies.
<unk> reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your <unk>
How do you do it?
Well, a very simple option would be a camera on every corner of the stadium right now, having a view from the top of the people that's below.
You also get information from the <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> something that's already working on.
And all that information is sent to your <unk>
The good teams will know <unk>
The bad guys will have information <unk>
This <unk> the good teams of the bad guys.
So your computer team will be as important as your <unk> and data analysis will stop being <unk>
It would be also to <unk> Who would have <unk>
How would it be in the <unk>
Imagine that it's the field.
<unk> the ball and <unk>
<unk> an open <unk> Suddenly, a <unk> on the left part of your bombsight -- you will tell you that a defense behind you is going to be <unk> you can't do it, but the <unk> system will be <unk>
It <unk> the protection.
Another <unk> <unk> you have an open <unk>
<unk> the <unk> but <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where to land. The receptor sees in their bombsight -- an area of grass that lights up and you can modify the race.
<unk> <unk> <unk> runs and <unk>
The <unk> <unk> and the fans have followed it from every angle.
This is something that creates a massive emotion in the game.
I'm going to do lots of people you see, because people want to live that experience.
<unk> want to be in the countryside, right?
They want to be your favorite player.
<unk> reality will be part of sport because it's too profitable to not be.
But what I ask you is, we want this to be the only use of <unk> reality.
We're going to use it just like bread and <unk> like our <unk> entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use augmented reality to foster empathy between human beings, to show someone what it is, literally, to be in someone else's place.
We know what this technology is worth for <unk>
It generates billions of income a year.
But how much is this technology worth for a teacher in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how bad their actions are <unk>
How much is this technology for a gay gay in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how it's being <unk>
How much is a <unk> or a <unk> Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children to think more in space and science instead of <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, the augmented reality is close.
The questions we do, the decisions we take and the challenges that we face, and the challenges we face, all of us.
Thank you.
I recently told me after 23 years of service in the <unk> <unk> of California.
Most of those 23 years ago -- the <unk> end of the <unk> County that includes the Golden Gate bridge.
The bridge is a <unk> structure, which is called the <unk> beautiful <unk> <unk> the Pacific Ocean.
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide, being one of the most used places in the world.
The Golden Gate Bridge was opened in <unk>
Joseph <unk> a chief engineer to build the bridge, said that, "The bridge is basically <unk>
<unk> from the bridge is not practical and practical and <unk>
But from its openness, over 1,600 people have jumped to his death from that bridge.
Some people think that traveling between the two towers will bring you to another dimension, this bridge has been <unk> as such, so that each of it releases you from all of your concerns and pain, and the waters that go below <unk> your soul.
But let me tell you that happens when the bridge is used to commit suicide.
After a free <unk> of five to five seconds, the body hits about 120 miles an hour.
The impact breaks bone, some of whom will make vital organs.
Most of the impact.
Those who don't normally get <unk> in the water and then <unk>
I don't think that <unk> this method of suicide <unk> will notice the death of the death of the <unk>
This is the wire.
Except for around the two towers, there's 32 inches of parallel steel the bridge.
This is where most people were in order to take away from life.
I can tell you for experience that once the person is at that edge, and at the darker time, it's very hard to bring them back.
I took this picture last year while this young man was talking to a official looking at his life.
I want to tell you with glad that we had successful that day to bring it back on the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we didn't have an formal training.
<unk> to channel the way through these calls.
This was not just a bad service to those who would <unk> suicide, but the officials as well.
We have a long way ever since.
Today, officials and psychologists are trained to train new official services.
This is Jason <unk>
I met him at 22, last year when I was getting a call from a <unk> subject sitting in the <unk> near the center.
<unk> and when I got there, I looked at Jason talking to an officer of the Golden Gate Bridge <unk>
Jason was only 32 years old, and he had flown up here from New Jersey.
In fact, they had flown up until two times before New Jersey to try suicide from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to <unk> we asked us if we knew the story of the box of <unk>
<unk> the mythology <unk> <unk> created <unk> and he sent it to the Earth with a box, and he said, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, curiosity could be more <unk> and she opened the box.
She came out of <unk> <unk> and all sorts of <unk> against man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So Jason said, "What happens if you open the box and there's no <unk>
He stopped <unk> leaned on the right, and he did.
This kind of <unk> guy in New Jersey had just had to take my life.
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, it didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, the rabbi rabbi called me to see how I was.
The parents of Jason the parents were all order.
<unk> from suicide <unk> affect a lot of people.
I pose these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or someone loved it was <unk>
What do you <unk>
<unk> what to say?
In my experience, you don't just have to talk, but you have to listen.
Listening to understand.
Don't <unk> <unk> or tell the person you know how you feel like it, because you probably don't know it.
Just being there, you can be the inflection point that you need.
If you think that someone is <unk> you're not afraid of <unk> and ask the question.
One way of asking you the question is, <unk> in similar circumstances have thought about finishing your life, you've had these <unk>
<unk> the person in front of it can save life and be the inflection point for them.
Other signs to <unk> despair, believe that things are terrible and that they're never going to be <unk> <unk> to believe that there is nothing you can do with <unk> social isolation, and a lost interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days ago, and I got an email from a lady and I'd like to read you his letter.
She lost his son on the 19th of January of this year, and he wrote this email just a couple of days ago, and he's with her permission and blessing that I read it.
"Hi, <unk> I imagine you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking that I should go standing on the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to your friends who tell your friends, etc.
I'm still pretty <unk> but noticing more moments of realizing that Mike will not go home.
Mike was driving from <unk> to San Francisco to see the <unk> party.
It never came there.
And I called the police of <unk> and <unk> it as they disappeared that night.
The next morning, two official came to my house and reported that the car of Mike was down in the bridge.
He watched him jump from the bridge to the <unk> on the late day of the previous day.
Thank you very much for fighting those who can be temporarily too weak to fight for themselves.
Who has not been before without having a true mental illness.
It shouldn't be that easy to end with it.
My prayers are with you for your struggle.
The <unk> the Golden Gate Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful <unk> not a <unk>
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and go on the path that his son took that day, and also the value to go forward.
I'd like to introduce you to a man who I mean by hope and value.
On March 11, 2005, I responded to a radio call for a possible <unk> in the sidewalk <unk> near the <unk>
I took my bike. I looked at this man, Kevin <unk> standing on the sidewalk.
When I saw me, he crossed the <unk> and stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
For the next half hour and the next half later, I heard about his depression and despair.
Now, Kevin decided to realize that day to go back on that lane and give life another chance.
When Kevin <unk> <unk>
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I asked him, "What was it that he did that they did to <unk> and gave her hope and life another <unk>
And you know what she told me?
He said, "I <unk>
They told me to speak and just <unk>
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from the Kevin, and I have that letter with me, and I would like to <unk>
"Dear Mr. <unk> Nothing erase the <unk> events and you're one of the reasons why Kevin is on with us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was <unk> for help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness for which it's been properly <unk>
I went to Kevin when I only had six months, completely unconscious of all of those <unk> <unk> but thank God, we now know.
Kevin is in order, as the says.
We can thank God for you.
<unk> on top of you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end, she writing, <unk> When I visited the General General in San Francisco that night, you <unk> like the patient.
<unk> I had to <unk>
Today, Kevin is a <unk> father and a member of society.
Talk openly about the events of that day and their depression with the hope that your story will inspire others.
<unk> is not just something I've found in the work.
It's personal.
My grandfather <unk> with poison.
That act, despite the end of his own pain, stealing the opportunity to meet me.
This is what suicide.
For most people who are <unk> or those who consider the suicide, wouldn't you think of hurt another person.
They just want their own chronic pain.
Typically, this gets only three things: sleep, drug or alcohol or death.
In my career, I responded and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illness and calls out of suicide around the bridge.
Of those incidents I have been directly involved, only lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who talked about about an hour.
And during that time, I was <unk> by three times.
In the end, he looked at me, and he said, "I'm sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
<unk> absolutely horrible.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of people that we come to contact with that bridge is not <unk>
Also, those few who have jumped on the bridge and lived and can talk about it, that one percent or two percent, most of those people have said that the second one left on the side of the fence -- realized they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge is not only connected to <unk> with San Francisco, but also to people.
That connection, or a bridge we do, is something that all and every one of us should be working on to do.
<unk> can be prevent.
There's help. There is hope.
Thank you very much.
The world causes you to be what you don't are, but in your inside, you know what you are, and a question you know, how do you stay in that?
I have to be something unique in that sense, but I'm not alone in that way.
When I became a model I felt that I had finally achieved the dream that I had ever been.
My outside finally <unk> with my inner truth, with my inner truth.
For a complicated thing, which I'm going to go back later, when I look at this picture and I'm looking at this picture -- I think, <unk> <unk>
But last October I discovered that, <unk> I'm just beginning.
We all <unk> our families, our religion, our society, our time in history, even our bodies.
Some of them have the value of <unk> to get rid of the limitations of our skin or by the beliefs of the people around us.
These are people who always defy the status quo, which is considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years, many of my neighbors -- a lot of my friends, my agent, agent ignored my story.
I think this mystery is called a revelation.
This is mine.
I found myself as <unk> at birth because of the appearance of my <unk>
I remember my five years in the Philippines, in my house, I was always wearing this shirt on his head.
And my mom wondered, "Why are you always wearing that t-shirt in the <unk>
I said, "Mom, it's my hair. I'm a <unk>
I knew how to make it <unk>
The gender has always considered a <unk> <unk> but now we know that it's actually a more complex and <unk>
Because of my success, I never challenged myself to share my story, not because I thought it will be what I'm bad, but because of how the world treats those of us who want to <unk>
Every day, I thank you to be a woman.
I have mom, dad and a family who do accept me as I am.
Many are not so fortunate.
There's a long tradition in the Asian culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist <unk> of compassion.
There's a <unk> goddess of <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the Philippines who celebrated these puzzles.
I was in front of the stage, and I remember that this beautiful woman came to me, and I remember that moment as if something happened to me. This is the kind of woman I would like to be.
And when I was 15 years old, when I was still using man, I met this woman called <unk>
It's the CEO of a <unk> <unk>
That night she asked me, "Why haven't you been involved in the <unk> competition.
He told me that if you were <unk> she was responsible for the <unk> and <unk> and that night, I won in <unk> he won in <unk> and he was a third <unk> among over 40 degrees.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was in the world of <unk>
Not many people can say that their first work was the queen of beauty of women, but I can do it.
I also met the <unk> <unk> especially when he <unk> remote <unk>
But more importantly, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001, my mother, who had moved to San Francisco, he called me and told me that passed my request from the green card that I could go to live in the U.S.
I was <unk>
I told my mother, "Mommy, I'm <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a queen of <unk>
But then, two weeks later, he called me and said, "You know that if you go to America you can change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested I would put two <unk> to my name.
She was also accompanied when I was <unk> in Thailand at 19 years.
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities from Thailand to do the most sophisticated surgeries and safe surgery.
In that time, in the U.S., it was necessary to have surgery before we changed the name and gender.
So in 2001, I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driving license with the name of <unk> and <unk>
It was a great moment.
For some people, their identity document means I could drive or be able to get a <unk> but for me to be the license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly, my fears saw <unk>
I felt I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and to be a model.
Many are not so fortunate.
I think of this woman in <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York City who was living his truth, but he <unk> he had end his life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All 20 of November, we make a global <unk> for <unk> Day.
I'm on this stage because of a long story of people that <unk> and stood up to injustice.
These are Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't keep living my truth alone and just me.
I want to do the best to help others live their truth without embarrassment, fear.
I'm here, <unk> so there is no longer more <unk> than 20 <unk>
My deepest truth led me to accept what I am.
Do you do it?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.  <unk> <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> first, thank you to all my <unk>
I have my support network, and my parents especially, to my family, who is very strong.
I remember all the time I've been to young women who have been <unk> and sometimes when they were called me and they told me that their parents couldn't take it, I took my mom and said, "Mommy, can you call this <unk>
Sometimes it works one other -- it's not just gender identity, that's what it's at the center of what we are, right?
I mean, we all assigned a gender to be born, and what I try to do is put on the table that sometimes some times that task was not block, and that there should be a space that would allow people to <unk> and this is a conversation that we should have with parents -- they were <unk>
The <unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
There should be understanding.
There should be space for curiosity and to ask questions, and I hope that all of you are my allies.
KS: Thank you. <unk> <unk> Thank you.
In many societies and tribal societies, to parents usually know about their children, but I'm one of the few parents who are known for their daughter and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started his campaign for education defending his rights in 2007. And when their efforts were <unk> their efforts in 2011, by <unk> the <unk> National Prize for peace, became very <unk> a very popular girl in his country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but I'm now his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you take a look at human history, the story of women is the story of the <unk> of inequality, of violence and exploitation.
You see, in <unk> societies right now from the beginning, when they were born, a young girl, their birth don't <unk>
It's not welcome, nor his father, not for his mother.
The neighborhood comes next to the mother and nobody <unk> the father.
And a mother was <unk> so much for having a child.
When it gives birth to the first child, the first child, it gets sad.
When it gives birth to the second daughter, <unk> and with the hope of a son, when he <unk> his third daughter, she feels guilty as a criminal.
Not just Mother <unk> but the daughter <unk> <unk> <unk> when it grows, she suffers too.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, she is left home and the school side of the siblings.
Until 12 years old in a way, it has a good life.
You can <unk>
He can play with your friends on the street, and it can move on the streets like a butterfly.
But when it comes into adolescence, when it goes into adolescence, when it comes into the <unk> you know, he goes out of his house without a male <unk>
It's confined to the four walls of the house.
It's no longer a free person.
It becomes the name of his father and her brothers and her family, and if you were to <unk> the code of that self, it could even kill.
And it's interesting that this thing of honor, not only affects the life of a <unk> it also affects the life of the male member members of the family.
So this brother, <unk> the joys of his life and happiness of her sisters in the name of honor.
And there's one more standard of societies that are called <unk>
It's supposed to be a good girl who has to be very <unk> very humble and very <unk>
That's the judgment.
The model of a good girl must be <unk>
It's supposed to be silent and accepting the decisions of his father and mother and people's decisions even if they don't want.
If <unk> with a man who doesn't like or if the <unk> with an old man, she has to <unk> because he doesn't want to be <unk> of <unk>
If the <unk> too young, she has to take it.
Otherwise, <unk> <unk>
And what happens to the end?
In the words of a <unk> "The <unk> the <unk> and then gives birth to more sons and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson from <unk> to his daughter and the same lesson from his children.
And this vicious cycle goes on and continues.
<unk> brothers and sisters, when I was born <unk> and for the first time, believe me, I don't like newborns, to be honest, but when I was there and I looked at her eyes, believe me, I felt incredibly <unk>
And so long before I <unk> I thought about her name, and I was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> de <unk> and I called my daughter like that.
But when I was <unk> they were all men, and I grabbed my pen, and I <unk> a line of my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she <unk> when she was four and a half years and a half years and the <unk> in my school.
So you might be wondering, why should I mention my <unk>
Yeah, I have to <unk>
You can give it for granted in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in the poor countries, in societies in <unk> in tribal societies, is a great event in the life of a child.
<unk> in a school means the recognition of his identity and his name.
One <unk> means that it has entered the world of the dreams and the aspirations where it can explore their potential for their future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and they would be <unk> two weeks before, when I was <unk> the form of <unk> Canadian and was in the relative part of the family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason I had never seen the names of my sisters written in no document.
That was the reason for my daughter.
What my father couldn't give my sisters not to her daughters, and I thought he had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and <unk> of my daughter.
I invite you to sit with me when my friends came to me.
The encouraged to go with these different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried to focus on your personality.
And this wasn't just for her, just to <unk>
I've put all these good values in my school to girls and girls in the same way.
I used education for the <unk>
<unk> my daughters, taught students, to forget the lesson of the <unk>
I taught students to forget the lesson of the so-called <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, <unk> for more rights for women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we found ourselves with a new phenomenon.
It was lethal rights for human rights, and in particular, for women's rights.
His name was <unk>
That means a complete <unk> of women's involvement in all the political and economic activities and social activities.
Hundreds of schools were gone.
The girls were banned to go to school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and they stopped going to markets.
The musicians were <unk> the girls were <unk> and the singers were killed.
<unk> millions, but few <unk> and it was terrifying to have around those people who kill and <unk> when you talk about their rights.
It's really terrifying.
When I was 10 years old, <unk> got up and raised by the right to education.
He wrote a newspaper for the blog of the BBC, offered her same for New York Times documentaries and talked about every platform he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
It <unk> like a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason that the Taliban could not tolerate his campaign and October ninth of 2012, he was shot in the head.
It was a day <unk> for my family and me.
The world became a big black hole.
While my daughter was <unk> in my life and death, he told me to my wife -- "I must get <unk> by what happened to my daughter, <unk>
And <unk> said to me, "Please don't <unk>
<unk> the fair cause.
<unk> your life for the cause of truth for the cause of peace, and the cause of education, and your daughter was inspired by you and <unk>
Both of them were on the right path and God <unk>
These few words were going to take a lot for me, and I didn't ask to ask again.
When I was <unk> I was in the hospital and I had severe pain and strong headaches because his facial nerve was cut down, I used to see a dark shadow that was <unk> by the face of my wife.
But my daughter never <unk>
I used to be <unk> I'm okay with my smile, and with my face.
I'm going to get right. Please don't <unk>
It was a comfort for us, and we <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, we've learned from her how to resist at the most difficult times, and I'm happy to share with you that despite being an icon for women's rights and women, it's like any 16 year-old girl.
<unk> when it doesn't have the task.
They fight their brothers, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What is special in my <unk> who has become so bold to <unk> so brave and <unk>
I'm telling you, I'm not wondering what I did.
<unk> what I didn't do.
I didn't cut his wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> of the brain 18 years ago, and since that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion.
I'm engineering.
And I want to tell you that I've recently joined the Google <unk> group, where I've had a <unk> to my <unk> the <unk> Google <unk> but all the work I'm going to talk about today about the science of the brain, I did it before I joined Google or outside of my work there.
Having said this, there is a stigma when you hit a brain operation.
You're still as smart or not?
It's not going to be like this, you'll be <unk>
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't the gray matter, but it was the dead part of the center that creates important hormones and <unk>
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide how much to make, of more than a dozen powerful chemicals every day, because if it didn't take anything, would die in a few hours.
Every day, over the last 18 years, I've had to decide about the combinations of the combinations and mix them together and try to get them alive.
More than I've been saved by a time.
But luckily, I have a soul of <unk> so I decided to be <unk> to try to get the <unk> dose, because there's really no clear map that I say in <unk>
I started to try and taste different <unk> and I was surprised when I saw how small changes in the doses in the <unk> dramatically my sense of who I think, my behavior with others.
A particularly <unk> case for a few months, I tried a dose and some typical chemical <unk> for a <unk> man, and I was surprised by how to look at how my thinking <unk>
I was always <unk> I thought all the time in sex, and I thought it was the smartest person around the world, and --  -- of course, a lot of times in the past I've met several guys like this, or maybe some <unk> versions of it.
It turned out as an extreme.
But my great surprise was that it wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was <unk> a little bit <unk> fixing a problem that had on the front, and it just didn't happen like this.
So I couldn't manage it.
I changed my <unk>
But I think that experience gave me a new appreciation for men and what they have to do -- since then I carry myself better with men.
What I was trying to do as I <unk> those hormones and neurotransmitters and so forth, I was to reclaim my intelligence after disease and <unk> my creative thinking, my flow of ideas.
I think almost always in images, and that became my key point of key <unk> how to do with those mental images I use to create <unk> my ideas, if we were <unk> <unk> new ideas and <unk> situations.
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> like <unk> Descartes and <unk> see things differently.
They thought that images and mental ideas were the same thing.
Today there are the people who challenge this idea, and there are a lot of arguments about how the mind works, for me is simple: for most of us, the mental images are fundamental to <unk> thinking and <unk>
So after several years, I would find the point right and I have already lots of great <unk> <unk> really <unk> very sophisticated and <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to take very quickly these mental images from my mind to the computer screen.
Can you imagine what would happen if a film director would be able to use their imagination only to lead the world that has the <unk>
Or if a musician could get the music for your head?
There are amazing possibilities with this, like the way creative people can get to share at the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty to achieve this is simply to increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
Let me show you why I think we're pretty close to this with two recent experiments that were done by two recent experiments in neuroscience.
They both used MRI technology, image of functional magnetic resonance to represent the brain. So you can see the brain scan done by <unk> <unk> and his colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left shows the scan of the brain that looks at an image.
The bottom column shows the scan of the brain that the brain scan as you <unk> to see that same image.
The column on the right one was created by <unk> the content of the central column on the left. You see the difference is almost <unk>
This <unk> in many different individuals with lots of different images, always with a similar result.
The difference between seeing an image and imagine the same picture is almost <unk>
Now, let me share another experiment. This is from the <unk> Jack <unk> lab in Berkeley, California.
They were able to turn the brain waves into the visual visual fields.
Let's put it this way.
In this experiment, I showed people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos while their brains were <unk> their brains to create a huge pool of reactions in the brain in front of the video.
And then I showed you a film with new, new people, new animals, and as long as they were <unk> a new <unk>
The computer is using just brain information on the scan of the scan -- to show you what it seemed like the person I was looking at.
On the right you can see the computer <unk> and on the left, the video that I showed you.
This left us <unk>
We're close to do that.
We just need to improve resolution.
And now remember, when you see a picture and when you imagine that same image, you think of the same picture, the same <unk>
This was conducted with <unk> brain scanning systems that were available today, and its resolution exploded as a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase the resolution of a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How do we get it?
There's a lot of techniques to do that.
One is opening up the skull and put electrodes electrodes.
I can't offer myself that one.
Many of them are proposing new techniques by images, even to me, <unk> with the recent MRI result -- we need to ask the following, this technology will be the end of the <unk>
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get more resolution, is with the bigger magnets -- but at this point, <unk> <unk> only offer small improvements on the resolution, not the gains for thousands as we need.
I propose this idea: Instead of larger magnets -- make better magnets.
Can we create structures much more complex -- slightly different <unk> like making a <unk>
And why does this matter?
In the last few years, a lot of effort on MRI was to make really big magnets -- right?
However, most of the recent advances in <unk> of <unk> and bright solutions in <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> and <unk> <unk> in MRI systems.
Instead, instead of a <unk> magnetic field, <unk> <unk> magnetic patterns -- <unk> <unk> <unk>
So by combining magnetic patterns with the patterns of radio processing patterns -- we can actually increase the information that can be produced in a single <unk>
Also, we can then divide in layers our growing knowledge about the structure of the brain and the memory to create the increase in the thousands of thousands of us that we need.
By using <unk> we should be able to measure not only the <unk> blood fluid -- but the <unk> hormones that I mentioned and maybe even direct neural activity -- this is sleep.
Will we be able to <unk> our ideas in a direct form of digital media.
Can you imagine if we could move above language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how do we learn how to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are great questions.
It would be <unk> used as a tool to amplify our thinking skills and communication.
Indeed, this same tool could lead to the cure for Alzheimer's and similar Alzheimer's disease.
We have a few options that will open this door.
Anyway, they choose a year to happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine that to take a lot more.
We have to learn how to take this step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you tonight about coming out of the closet, and not in a traditional sense, not just the gay closet.
I think we all have <unk>
Her closet is maybe saying to some person for the first time he loves her or tell somebody who's pregnant, or tell somebody who has cancer, or any other hard conversation that you have ever <unk> in life.
I all spend a difficult conversation, and even though our issues can vary <unk> the experience of I've got to have lived and have come out of that closet is a universal thing.
It's <unk> and we don't like it to happen.
A lot of years ago, I was working on the South Side of the South Side -- <unk> a restaurant in the city, and I was there, I had to go through a number of stages of the intensity of the <unk> <unk> -- not <unk> my armpits, quote the letters of <unk> <unk>
And I'll be <unk> from my <unk> <unk> and I had my head -- I was doing a little bit, I would usually ask a child to say, "Hey, you're a kid or a <unk>
And there would be uncomfortable silence at the table.
<unk> my jaw a little bit more, I would take my coffee with a <unk>
The father <unk> <unk> the newspaper and the mother tossed a cold <unk> her son.
But I would not say anything, and I <unk> inside.
And I got to the point that every time I went to a place where there was a kid between three and 10 years old, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised myself that the next time I would say something.
I would have that hard conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
"You're a guy or a <unk>
A family silence was, but this time I was ready and was about to get into the female issues at the table.  I had the quotes from Betty <unk>
<unk> <unk>
Even a fragment of the "Vagina Monologues," I <unk>
So I took a bit of a breath and I got the look at my back and my back a <unk> girl with a pink dress, staring at what is not a challenge for a <unk> <unk> just a girl with a question: "You're a little girl with a question: "You're a kid or <unk>
So I took a long amount of <unk> again, I stood up close to her, and I said, "Hey, I know this is something confusing.
I have the short hair like the one of a kid, and I have a girl, and I am a girl, and you know, like you like to wear a pink dress and sometimes you like to wear a comfortable pajamas.
Now, I'm more than a <unk> girl <unk>
And that girl looked at me, <unk> attention, and he said, "My favorite pajamas.
Can you give me a <unk> <unk>
And that was all <unk> OK. You're a girl.
What about the <unk> <unk>
It was the easiest conversation for everybody ever had.
And by <unk> because the girl of the <unk> and I, both of us were <unk> one with the other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some <unk> in my life, and yes, often, my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside, you can't know what color are the walls.
You just know how one feels like living in a closet.
This is how my closet is not different from you or yours or yours.
I will give you a hundred reasons why it comes out of my closet it was harder to come out of his, but this is the <unk> the hard thing is not <unk>
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell me that to explain to someone who have served in bank banking is more difficult than saying it's been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story that I tell you is more difficult to tell your five-year-old son than you're going to <unk>
There's no more difficult thing, there's only the hard thing.
We have to stop classifying what is difficult to be hard with respect to the other person to make us feel better or worse in relation to our <unk> and we should just feel empathy because we all live something hard.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and they can make sense of security, or at least security than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that no matter what your walls are made -- a closet is not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine yourself 20 years ago.
And I had a horse, a horse and <unk> shoes.
It was not the militant lesbian ready to fight any <unk> <unk>
It was frozen frozen in a corner of my dark closet <unk> my gay <unk> and moving only a muscle is the scariest thing ever ever done.
My family, my friends, full of strangers who have spent my entire life trying to do not <unk> and now the world was turning on to purpose.
I was burning the pages of an script that we've all followed by so long, but if you don't toss that <unk> to kill you.
One of my <unk> launches was in my sister.
It was the first time that many of the guests knew that I was gay, and I was doing my <unk> <unk> in my black dress and <unk> walked around the tables and finally came to one where the friends were my parents, people who knew me years old.
And after talking a moment, one of the women <unk> <unk> at Nathan <unk>
And the gay story had begun.
Have you ever been in the <unk>
"Well, yes, the truth is that we have friends in San <unk>
"Well, we've never gone there, but we've heard that it's <unk>
<unk> You meet my <unk> <unk>
It's very good and it's never talked about having <unk>
<unk> what is your favorite <unk> show.
Our favorite program Will and <unk>
And you know who <unk> <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but hopefully I'm trying to show your support, to get me to know that I was on my side, he finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband uses shirts, <unk>
And I had an opportunity at that moment, as you have all the <unk> <unk>
<unk> might have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not very hard to find them and realizing the fact that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask someone, but <unk>
If you're going to be authentic with somebody, you have to be prepared for how authentic they <unk>
It's like the hard conversations still remain my strong point.
Ask anybody that I have <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I follow what I like to call the three principles of <unk>
Now, please look at this through the gay perspective, but understand that what it involves getting out of any closet is essentially the same thing.
Number one: Be authentic.
<unk> <unk> Be yourself.
That girl in coffee had no armor but I was ready for battle.
If you want someone to be <unk> others need to know that we do suffer.
Number two: Be <unk> just <unk> <unk> your <unk>
If you know they're gay, <unk>
If they say to your parents who might be gay, they will maintain the hope that that could change.
Don't give them a sense of false hope.
And number three, and more important --  Let the complex.
You communicate your truth.
It would never be <unk> for that.
And some of them can come out of safe, safe wounded -- so they've never done, but I'm never sorry for what they are.
And yes, maybe some will feel <unk> but that is something in them.
Those are the expectations of what you are, but not your own.
That's the story of them, but not of you.
The only story that matters is that you want to write.
So the next time you find in a dark closet <unk> a <unk> you have to know that we've all been there before.
And they may be very alone; they are not.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
<unk> what is that?
If you look at the story of how intelligence has seen the intelligence, a productive example has been the famous <unk> quote that "The question of whether a machine can think is as interesting as the question of whether a submarine can <unk>
When <unk> <unk> wrote this as a criticism of computing as Alan <unk>
And so, some years ago, we set up a program to try to understand the fundamental physical mechanisms of intelligence.
Let me take a step back.
We first start with a mental experiment.
Imagine that they are from an alien race that you don't know about the biology of the Earth or from neuroscience of the Earth or the intelligence of the Earth, but they have incredible telescopes and you can look at the Earth, and they have incredibly long lives, so you can see Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as <unk> we know that the reason is that we're trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you're from a alien alien who doesn't know anything about this, which doesn't have any concept about the intelligence of the Earth, it would be forced to develop a physical theory that would explain how, to a certain time at the time, the asteroids that <unk> the surface of a <unk> planet stop doing it.
And so I claim that this is the same question that understanding the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that took a number of years ago, I looked at a variety of issues through science, through various disciplines that <unk> I think, to a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there have been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be properly harnessed for the development of intelligence, and in particular, for the development of universal states that <unk> diversity of potential future.
And finally, in the robotic movement, there's been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of robots to maximize future freedom of action in order to perform complex tasks.
And so I took all these different issues and <unk> together, I said, for a number of years, there is a underlying mechanism for the intelligence that we can extract from all these different <unk>
There's just an equation for <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent of a E = <unk> for the intelligence that I have ever seen.
So what you're looking at here is a claim that intelligence is a <unk> <unk> that acts in order to maximize the future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize the future freedom of action, or to keep the options open with a force that has a T, with the diversity of possible future accessible, <unk> to an impending future time, <unk>
In a few words, the intelligence doesn't like to stay <unk>
<unk> is trying to maximize future freedom of action and keep the choices open.
And so you have in mind this equation, it's natural to ask: What can you do with this?
How <unk> is it?
<unk> the level of human <unk>
<unk> <unk> intelligence.
So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, will show some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology has suggested that universes that produce more disorder, or <unk> during their life should be more favorable conditions for intelligent things like us.
But what if that connection is that <unk> <unk> between entropy and intelligence.
What if intelligent behavior is not only correlates with the production of entropy in the long term, but it actually comes directly from it?
To find out, we've developed a software engine called <unk> which is designed to maximize the production of entropy in any system in any system that will be found.
<unk> <unk> could spend multiple animal intelligence tests -- play games, and even make money <unk> actions, all of it without that there would have been right to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Just like a human standing human, here we see <unk> automatically <unk> a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable partly because we never gave him a goal.
He just decided to balance the <unk>
This ability to balance is going to have applications for <unk> robotics and technologies of human care.
This ability of tools will have applications in smart manufacturing and agriculture.
Also, like some other animals can cooperate pulling on opposite sides of a rope at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can make a version of the model of that task.
This ability of cooperation has interesting implications for economic planning for economic planning and in a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable at a variety of <unk>
For example, here we see it successfully playing a game of <unk> against itself, <unk> its potential for play.
Here we see <unk> orchestrate new connections in a social network where our friends are constantly <unk> and keeps the very <unk> network.
This same network capacity also has applications that have applications also has applications in health care, in energy and intelligence.
Here we see <unk> organizing the routes of a fleet of ships, discovering with success and using the Panama Canal to scale up in the world from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applicable to problems in <unk> and logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we see <unk> spontaneously discover and running a strategy of <unk> <unk> in a <unk> series of <unk> and successfully increasing the assets under its management exponentially.
This ability of risk risk will have massive applications in finance and <unk>
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of brands of human cognitive behaviors such as use of tools, walking upright and social cooperation and social cooperation -- all flow from one equation, which leads to a system to maximize their future freedom of action.
Now, here's a profound <unk>
So let's go back to the beginning of the use of the term -- the <unk> play, there was always the concept that if we had smart machines, there would be a <unk> rebellion in it.
The machines were <unk> against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all of these decades, we've had the whole concept of rebellion in reverse.
It's not that the machines first become smart and then <unk> and trying to take over the world.
It's all the opposite, that the impulse to take control of all of the future of all possible future is a more fundamental principle than the intelligence of intelligence, that general intelligence can actually come out directly to make the control, rather than the other way around.
Another significant consequence is the search for the target.
They often ask me, how do you look for targets and learn from this kind of <unk>
My equivalent to that statement to move to the descendants of them to help them build artificial artificial artificial intelligence or to help them understand human intelligence, is this: The intelligence has to be viewed as a physical process that tries to maximize future freedom of action and avoid constraints in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at a tipping point in human history, something between the <unk> of stars and losing the planet that we call <unk>
Except, over the last few years, we've extended our knowledge of how the Earth fits into the context of the universe.
The Kepler Kepler has discovered thousands of possible planets orbiting other stars, which points to the Earth is only one between the billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope that measures the faint <unk> intensity of stars when the planets go through in front of them, they block a little bit of that light that comes to us.
The data collected by Kepler show the sizes of planets besides the distance that there is between them and their stem star.
Together, this helps us understand whether these planets are small and <unk> like the Earth Earth of our solar system, and also the amount of light that they get from their suns.
Instead, this gives you clues about whether these planets we find are <unk>
Unfortunately, while we're finding this trove of potentially <unk> worlds our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
<unk> was the hottest recorded.
<unk> and ice ice that have been with us for 100 now are now disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that have caused global scale have rapidly <unk> our ability to alter their course.
But I am not a science scientist or the weather, or <unk>
I study the <unk> of the planet influenced by the stars, with the hope of finding places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
You could say that I look for alien opportunities in the world.
Now, as a very interested person in the search for life in the universe I can tell you that the more you look for planets like the Earth, most of our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invites a comparison between the newly discovered and the planets that we know <unk> our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor, Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite being a little bit further away from the Sun, it can be considered a potentially livable world shown for a mission like the Kepler <unk>
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been <unk> in the past, and in part, that's why we studied so much to Mars.
Our <unk> like the <unk> track their surface into clues about the origins of life as we know it.
The satellites that were <unk> like the <unk> mission is taking samples from the <unk> atmosphere, and try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
Business companies now offer not just short flight flights but also the <unk> chance of living on Mars.
But even though all these <unk> images remind us to the deserts of our planet, places that are linked to our imagination with ideas and <unk> and compared to the Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live in.
Let's take the extension of the <unk> areas of our planet that are still in <unk> places that are really <unk> in comparison to Mars.
Even in the most dry and <unk> places on the Earth, the air is cool and full of oxygen <unk> by our tropical forests thousands of miles away.
I worry that this excitement for the colonization of Mars and other planets will drag with a large and sad <unk> the implication and the belief of some that Mars will expect there to save this <unk> <unk> of the only planet that we know that it's truly habitable Earth.
For a lot of the <unk> exploration, I'm in deep disagreement with this idea.
There's a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars will be there to <unk> humanity is like imagine that the captain of the Titanic will tell you that the <unk> really will have place in the <unk> --   Thank you.
But the targets for <unk> exploration and environmental preservation are not <unk>
No, they are actually faces of the same <unk> the goal of understanding, preserve and improve life in the future.
The extreme environments in our world look like <unk> <unk>
It's just closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and keep gaps in the hostile and <unk> areas of the ground, maybe we can meet the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
I'll leave you with an experiment that was <unk> the paradox of <unk>
Many years ago, the physicist Enrico Fermi said, "Well, that our universe has been around for a long time, and we hope that there were many planets in this universe, we should have found the evidence of life that we should have found out of alien life <unk>
Well, where are they?
Well, a possible solution to the paradox of Fermi is that when civilizations become advanced advanced enough to consider living between the stars, they lose the notion of the importance of the planets that <unk> this development.
It's <unk> to think that only <unk> will save us about ourselves, but planetary preservation and exploration, can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to look at the hostile environments of Mars for human presence, then we should be able to overcome the even easier task to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I <unk> my own house.
And while I was on the front porch looking at my pockets, I realized I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window that they were at the table of the dining table where I had <unk>
So fast I tried to open all the other doors and windows, and they were all pretty close.
I thought I'd call a <unk> at least I had my cell phone, but midnight, one <unk> could take a long time to get it cold.
I couldn't go back home from my friend of Jeff <unk> I had a flight early in Europe at the next morning, and I <unk> from my passport and my suitcase.
<unk> expensive, but you certainly have no more expensive than an hour at the middle of the night, so I thought that despite the <unk> in the <unk> room.
I'm a neuroscientist, a little bit about how the brain works under stress.
<unk> <unk> that increases cardiac rhythm, <unk> the <unk> levels of adrenaline and <unk> the thought.
And when I got to the counter counter at the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I began to wonder, if there was something that I could do, systems that I could put in place that I would think about bad things.
Or at least, if you have bad things -- that you can do bad things, which is the likelihood that it is a total catastrophe to be.
So I started thinking about that, but even one month later my thoughts didn't work.
I was having dinner with my colleague Danny <unk> who won the Nobel Prize, and a little embarrassed to tell him about breaking the window, and I had forgotten my passport, and Danny shared with me who had been practicing with something called <unk> <unk>
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written about this a few years before, known as the <unk>
You all know what the <unk> is.
Every time there's a disaster, a team of experts come and try to figure out what came wrong, right?
In the <unk> as explains <unk> you look forward and tries to figure out all the things that might go wrong, and then tries to figure out what it can do to prevent things out or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk to you about is some things that we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> others are not so evident.
I'm going to start with the obvious <unk>
In the house, you get a place for things that are very easily.
This sounds kind of common sense and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space memory.
There's a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to track the location of the important things, where the good, where the fish are, where the fish are living -- which is where the friends are working and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that <unk> in the <unk> in London.
It's the part of the brain that allows <unk> to find its nuts.
And if you asked if someone actually did the experiment, they cut the sense of <unk> <unk> and they still could find its nuts.
They weren't using smell, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism of the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move much, not so good for things that move too much.
This is the reason for losing the car and read <unk>
So at home we had a place for the keys, a hook with the door, maybe a dish.
For your passport, a particular drawer in it.
For your reading, a particular <unk>
If you take a place and they're <unk> with it -- your stuff will always be there when the <unk>
What about <unk>
Take the cell phone a picture of your credit card license, you leave your drive, you go through yourself so you're in the cloud.
If these things lose or <unk> it can facilitate <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when you're under stress, your brain releases <unk>
<unk> is <unk> and <unk> the thought.
So part of <unk> practice is to recognize that <unk> will not be at the best moment, and you have to put systems on their site.
And there are perhaps not more stressful thinking than when you face a medical decision.
And at some point, we will all be in that situation, to have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical attention or the way of being loved to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this was <unk> as a <unk> for all making of medical decisions and actually for decision-making and social decisions and social decisions, any kind of decision that you have to benefit from the rational of the facts.
So suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I've got the result of the laboratory and the cholesterol result is a little bit <unk>
Everybody knows that high cholesterol cholesterol is associated with a higher risk of heart disease, heart <unk>
So you're thinking that having high cholesterol cholesterol is not the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to <unk> a drug that will help reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And maybe you have heard of the <unk> and you know that it's one of the most <unk> drugs in the world today, and it's even likely to know people who are <unk>
So you think, "Yes, <unk> the <unk>
But there's a question that you have to do then, a statistic that you should ask for that most doctors don't want to talk about, and pharmaceutical companies even less.
It's for <unk> the number you need to treat.
And what is this, <unk>
It's the number of people who need to take a drug or to submit to a surgery in any medical procedure before you help a person.
And you must think about what kind of statistic is <unk>
The number has to be one.
My doctor didn't tell me something if I wasn't going to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not <unk> and if it's <unk> it's about scientists like me.
We haven't understood the <unk> mechanisms.
But the estimates of <unk> that 90 percent of our drugs works only about 30 percent of the people.
So the number you need to treat the most widely <unk> more widely <unk> what do you think is?
How many people have to take it before you can help a person?
300.
This according to the research of the researchers cynical <unk> <unk> and Pamela <unk> <unk> independently <unk>
I explored the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before they avoid a single heart attack, stroke brain or another <unk> event.
Now you might think, "Well, one probability on 300 to lower my <unk>
Why not, <unk> <unk> the recipe for all of the <unk>
But then you have to ask for a more statistic and it is, <unk> of the <unk> <unk> Right?
For this particular drug, the side effects are produced by five percent of patients.
And those include <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> pain and <unk> pain -- but now they think, <unk> is not very likely to happen to me, still take the <unk>
But a moment.
Now remember, <unk> you don't think clearly.
So think of how you do this with the time, so you don't have to make the string of reasoning on the act.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has <unk> five percent of the 300 people have side effects, that's 15 people.
One has 15 times more likely to go out with the drug that helps you the drug.
I'm not saying they should or not take the <unk>
I'm just saying that you should have this conversation with your doctor.
The health ethic is need, it's part of the early informed <unk>
We have a right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about whether you want to take the risks or not.
You may be thinking that I've launched this number in the air for the value of the crash, but actually this number necessary number to treat is quite typical.
For the surgery that the most is done in the older men of 50, <unk> prostate cancer, the number you need to deal with is <unk>
This is 49 surgeries for one person who has <unk>
And the side effects in that case is produced by 50 percent of patients.
Those include <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you're lucky, and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects just a year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think before the questions that you can make to make the conversation forward.
You don't have to make all this stuff on the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because it's got a choice -- many times, they want a shorter life free of pain, or a longer life that could have much pain to the end?
These are the things that they talk about and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
You can change in the heat of the moment, but at least you're trained in this kind of thought.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that moment is they turn out a lot of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
Face with a predator -- you don't need the <unk> system or <unk> or your immune system, because if the body is spending the metabolism on those things, it doesn't react very quickly. You could get to be lunch for the lions, so none of that matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that go through the window during those moments of stress is the rational thought like Danny <unk> and his colleagues have shown.
So we need to <unk> to think about the future of these kinds of situations.
I think the important thing here is to recognize that we're all <unk>
We're all going to fail at the time.
The idea is to think about the future how those <unk> might be able to put systems in the place that will help minimize harm, or to stop the bad things in the first place.
I went to the night in <unk> when I came back from my journey, my contractor installed a <unk> of combination with the door, with a key <unk> to the gate in the same time, an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of letters that I haven't ordered and lots of email messages that I haven't read.
So I'm not very <unk> but I see the organization like a <unk> process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite <unk>
It means <unk> <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument, and you see a <unk> on <unk> you need to play <unk>
Two <unk>
Four <unk> extremely smooth.
This is my drawing from a <unk> tree, there you see that no matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> can be never <unk> to a complete silence.
That's my current definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I would like to share a little bit about the history of the American system, the <unk> in addition to a little bit of my own story.
The French signs of French came in the time in 1800, and over the time, she mixed with local signs, and developed the language we now know as <unk>
So it has a story of about 200 years.
I was born <unk> And I was taught to believe that sound wasn't a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
However, I realize that it's not true for anything.
The sounds are a very important part of my life, really in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person, living in a world of sound, is as if I lived in a foreign country, following their rules, <unk> behaviors and norms without <unk>
So how do you understand <unk>
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like <unk> and <unk> the sound.
It was <unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sound, and I've seen how people <unk>
So I have learned, for example.
"Don't <unk> <unk>
"Don't do a lot of noise when you eat the bag of <unk> <unk>
"Don't <unk> and when you're eating, make sure we didn't have the <unk> in the <unk>
I call this <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think of the sound tag more than the average person does it.
I'm super <unk>
And I'm always waiting for <unk> the sound, which is about to come next.
<unk> this picture.
<unk> for decide.
<unk> to continue.
<unk> for <unk>
You can see that <unk> doesn't have notes in the lines.
That's because the lines already contain sounds through the subtle and subtle <unk>
In <unk> culture, movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the signal to <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, to me, making it with my thumb that doesn't feel natural.
That's why in my drawings I just have four lines on the paper.
In 2008, I had the opportunity to travel in Berlin, Germany, for an artistic <unk> there.
Before this time, I had worked as a <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums and spaces of different <unk> and while I went from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that point, the sound was the trend and that called me the <unk>
There was no visual art, everything was <unk>
Now sound has entered my territory of art.
I'll tell you more about art?
I realized that it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that you don't only experience through the ears.
I can feel it <unk> or really experience it visually, or even this one idea.
So I decided to reclaim the property of sound and <unk> in my art practice.
And everything that had taught me as the sound of sound, I decided to leave and <unk>
I started to create a new body of work.
And when I presented it to the art community, I was struck with the amount of support and attention I got.
I realized that sound is like money, power, the social currency.
At the bottom of my mind, I always felt that sound was <unk> it was a <unk> person.
And sound is so powerful that it could be <unk> to me and my artistic job, or I could be <unk>
I chose to be <unk>
There's a massive culture around speech language.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is like I didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me from the same, and become my voice.
So I am able to be relevant in today's society.
So in school, in the work and institutions, work with many different performers from <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and a identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, for <unk> your voices, I'm able to maintain a temporary form of value as well as taking a loan out of a very high interest rate.
If I will not continue to keep this practice, I feel that I could be <unk> in the <unk> and not have any social value.
So with sound like my new artistic environment, <unk> in the world of music.
And I was surprised by seeing the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note cannot capture and completely express on the paper.
And the same thing can be said from a concept in <unk>
The two are very <unk> and highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can affect all of the signs as much as the sounds of sound.
I'd like to share with you a metaphor for the piano, to understand how the <unk> works.
So, imagine a piano.
<unk> divide in many different parameters <unk>
If you set up a different <unk> for every finger while you get the piano, like facial expression, the motion of the body, the speed, the way you play the piano, the English is a linear language, as if it <unk> just one key at once.
However, <unk> is more like a chord -- you need the 10 fingers in the way to express a clear concept or idea in <unk>
If a key player would change the chord -- it would create a completely different meaning.
Same thing is happening with the music in terms of pitch, <unk> and volume.
In <unk> by using these different <unk> parameters you can express different ideas.
For example, the signal <unk> in that."
This is the <unk> sign in that."
I'm looking at you.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, I <unk>
oh. oh.
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I started thinking, and if I see <unk> through the glasses of music?
If I had to create a sign and do it again and again, it could be like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the sign of <unk> the sun comes out.
This is <unk>
If you get it and <unk> the visually speed, it looks like a piece of music.
The whole day.
I feel that the same thing can be said to <unk> the <unk>
"All the <unk>
This is all night in this picture.
And this led me to think about three different kinds of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> --  <unk> <unk>
I feel that the third one has more <unk> than the other two.
This represents how time expressed time in <unk> and how distance the body can express changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand, two <unk> is two hands, the present gets closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body and the past is on the back.
So the first example is a long time for a long time.
Then, <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last one, which is my favorite, with a very romantic idea and dramatic at once, <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a specific pace of four times by <unk>
However, when I see the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically in <unk> same time."
Watch <unk> right hand, <unk> left hand.
We have <unk> through the head and the chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I'm going to show you a form of hand called <unk> <unk>
Can you do it with me?
All the hands of the hands.
Now we're going to do so much in your head like your chest, something like <unk> <unk> or <unk>
Yeah, pretty good.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as a note, is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and languages worldwide.
The second one I'd like to show you is this. Please do it again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in <unk>
Now, the third. Please <unk> again.
And again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
We're going to do three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job.
Look at how the three signs are very similar. They all happen in your head and the chest but they transmit very different.
It's amazing to see how <unk> live and thriving just like music.
However, today, we live in a very <unk> world.
And only because the <unk> has no sounds, it doesn't automatically have social value.
We have to start questioning what defines the social value and allow <unk> to develop its own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a more <unk> society.
And maybe people understand that you don't have to be deaf to learning <unk> I don't have to hear the music.
<unk> is a <unk> <unk> and I'd like you to have the same experience.
I'd like to encourage you to open your ears, open your ears, to participate in our culture and experience our visual language.
And it never knows, they can fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents were saying, "You can tell you everything, but then you have to <unk>
Freedom involves responsibility.
But my imagination led me to all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a bubble of innocence or a bubble of ignorance I must say, because adults would lie to us to protect ourselves from horrible truth.
When I became older -- I learned that adults also <unk> and that they're not really good at cleaning the other of others.
The time happened, I'm now adult teach and invention in the <unk> school of Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait much for my students to walk through the beach with lots of rubbish.
So as good citizens, we cleaned up the <unk> and no, he's not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I don't know it.
It's sad to say, but more than 80 percent of the oceans have plastic.
It's something creepy.
And in the last decades, we've been coming out with these large ships and networks, and we set up those bits of plastic to study them under the microscope, and the <unk> and <unk> this information on a map.
But hard for eternity and it's very expensive and it's also very risky to use these huge boats of them.
So together with my students, with ages six to 15 years, we dream to invent a better way.
We've transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started building this <unk> of work with <unk> work so that the kids very <unk> can also participate.
And I'm going to tell you, the kids who manipulate electrical tools, feel great and secure.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect plastic and we cut it down to the size that we find it in the ocean, which is very small, because of its <unk>
We do.
I leave it to the imagination of my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas of every child and try to get them into something that we hope to work.
We decided that instead of collecting bits of plastic, just <unk> information.
By using a robot, we take a picture of this <unk> the children will get a lot with the robots.
Then we did quickly what we call "a <unk>
We're so fast in the creation of prototypes that we ended up before lunch.
And we transform light and web cameras, and you get it into a floating robot that will move slowly through the water and the plastic we have there, and this is the picture captured by the robot.
We see the bits of plastic floating slowly through the sensor while the computer on board processing this image and measure the size of each <unk> to get an estimate of the amount of plastic in the water.
I took this invention to step through a website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that someone would take it even more.
The cool thing about this project is that students saw a local problem, and they are trying to fix it immediately.
I'm able to investigate my <unk> problem, but my students in Hong Kong are children very well informed.
You see the news news, which is the Internet, and it was <unk> with this picture.
One child, maybe less than 10 years old, cleaning up an oil spill, just using the hands of the hands, in <unk> the world's largest <unk>
It was very surprised because this is the water that <unk> is the water where the water <unk> the water where they live.
You can also see that the water is brown and the oil is also brown color, and when you're all <unk> it's very hard to see what's in the water.
But there's a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what's in the water.
We built a first prototype of a <unk> that can <unk> through all kinds of substances that produce different <unk> which can help identify what's in the water.
We had this prototype with a sensor and sent it to Bangladesh.
The great thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or to look at a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help other children.
I was forced to look at a problem with <unk> I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little bit further, maybe to address a more difficult problem, and also closer to me.
I'm half Japanese and French half -- probably remember, in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that he started several giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> <unk> several cities on the east coast of Japan.
Over 14 people died in a second.
It also gives the nuclear power plant in Fukushima, a nuclear power plant as well.
And today, according to the reports of the 300 tons are still leaking from the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, the entire Pacific Ocean has traces of pollution by <unk>
If we go to the west, we can measure the radiation of <unk> everywhere.
But if you look on the map, it looks like the bulk of the radiation disappeared from the Japanese coast -- and the most part, of the time, it has a safe aspect of blue.
Well, reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I've gone back to <unk> every year from the accident and independently with other scientists, the land, the river, and this time we wanted to bring the kids.
Of course not the <unk> the parents don't <unk>
But every night, you get to the center of <unk> here you see the use of different masks here.
It might seem like they didn't take work seriously, but they did it because they are going to have to live with <unk> all of their life.
Together with them we discussed the <unk> data that day and we talked about what we were going to do next, strategies, <unk> etc.
And to do this, we created a <unk> map of the region around the nuclear energy plant.
We created the map of <unk> <unk> pigment to make data in real time of <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
With this we were able to notice that the radioactive powder was <unk> from the top of the mountain to the <unk> system and <unk> in the ocean.
It was an estimate <unk>
But based on this we organized a civil expedition to the nearest plant to date.
We are approaching up to 1.5 miles of the nuclear <unk> and with the help of fishermen of the area -- we were collecting sediments from the sea <unk> with a little <unk> <unk> as we invented and build.
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem to a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with open-source technologies and very simple technologies.
But at the same time, it's been more and more frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage we've done.
We haven't even started trying to solve problems.
I wonder if we should take the leap and try to invent better ways of doing all these things.
So the classroom became so small so so much, we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong and we turned it into the largest space dedicated to social impact and environmental impact.
It's in the center of Hong Kong and it's a place where we can work with wood, metal chemistry, a little bit of biology -- basically, you can build almost everything there.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It's a place where the dreams of children can actually become the help of adults, and where adults can be children again.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> we asked things, like, we can invent the future of mobility with <unk> energy.
For example.
Or, we can help at mobility at the time of the advanced age transforming their standard wheels in new vehicles in new vehicles.
<unk> oil and <unk> are <unk> terrible, but the worst legacy we can leave our kids are lies.
We cannot afford to protect the children of the horrible truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So, citizens scientists, <unk> must be preparing to the next generation to get care about the environment and people, and so that I can actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two domes -- two <unk> different cultures.
One is made of thousands of pieces of steel, the other one of a silk <unk>
One is synthetic -- the other organic one.
One is placed over the environment, the other thing thought he would be.
One is designed by nature, the other for it.
Miguel angel said that when he looked at the <unk> <unk> he saw a figure that struggle to be free.
The <unk> was unique to Michelangelo.
But living things are not <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, the cells, we took all the information that required it for every cell to work and to help them.
The tools also have consequences.
At least since the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has mastered <unk> of manufacturing and mass production.
The assembly line has dictated a world that's made of parts, <unk> the imagination of designers and architects trained to think their objects as <unk> of <unk> parts with different functions.
But you don't find <unk> material in nature.
Think of human skin, for example.
Our facial skins are thin with <unk> <unk>
The skins of the back is thick with little <unk>
You act primarily like filter the other mostly as barrier, and yet it's the same <unk> there's no parts, no <unk>
It's a system that changes its functionality through variation in <unk>
Here's a split screen that represents my view of the world -- the <unk> of every designer and an architect to work on the right now between the <unk> and the gene, between the assembly and growth between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the right hemisphere is shown on the two screens after me.
My job at its simplest level is about bringing these two visions of the world, away from the assembly and approaching growth.
You probably ask, Why do we now?
Why couldn't this be possible about 10 years or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a rare moment, where you have four disciplines that offers access to tools that we never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I create.
Please know the minds and the hands of my students.
We designed objects, products, structures and tools and tools through large scale, like this robotic arm with a grasp of 24 meters in diameter with a working basis that one day is not very far to print <unk> buildings and graphics to the nanoscale made of genetically engineered <unk>
Here we have <unk> the <unk> an archetype of the ancient Arab architecture, and it has created a screen where every aperture is size to shape the shape of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explore the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> this was for a fashion show of Paris with <unk> they're going to be <unk> It's like a second skin made from one piece, <unk> in the flexible <unk> around the waist.
Along with <unk> 3D printing -- we print this layer and 3D <unk> with no seams between the cells -- I'll show you more objects like that.
This helmet combines soft and <unk> materials in the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a <unk> scanner as well.
That designers have access to this high resolution, and the <unk> instruments allow us to design products that are <unk> not only how our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We also designed a acoustic chair, a chair at the same time, comfortable and it absorbs sound.
The Carter professor, my collaborator, <unk> back to the nature of <unk> and by designing this <unk> pattern becomes <unk>
<unk> this surface of 44 different properties, which vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> to the pressure points in the human body.
Its surface, like in nature, changes its functionality not by the addition of other material or another <unk> but <unk> continuously and <unk> the material property.
But it is nature <unk>
There is no parts in nature?
I didn't raised myself in a religious <unk> but when I was young, my grandmother told me stories about the Bible <unk> and one of them came to me and would define a lot of what I care about.
As she <unk> "In the third day of <unk> God sends the Earth to grow a <unk> <unk> <unk>
For that first <unk> tree there would no difference between <unk> branches, branches, and <unk>
The entire tree was a piece of fruit.
Instead, the land was growing up with branches, <unk> <unk> and flowers.
The land created a world made over.
I often ask myself, "What would the design be if objects made them from a single part?
<unk> a better state of the <unk>
So we looked for the material -- the kind of material of the tree <unk> with fruit and we found it.
The second most abundant <unk> on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons are produced every year for organisms like shrimp, <unk> <unk> and <unk>
We think that if we could tune in your properties, we could generate <unk> structures in one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it a legal <unk>  We asked a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> and produced <unk>
<unk> the chemical concentrations -- we've been able to achieve a wide range of properties, from dark, hard and <unk> to the light, soft and transparent.
To print on the large-scale structures that was built a system with multiple <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>
So the robot could vary the properties of the material on the march and create these structures made of a single <unk> material -- 100 percent recycled.
When the pieces are ready, it leaves them dry them to find a natural way in touch with the air.
So why do we keep designing with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process used to be used to contain <unk> <unk> that first has three billion years ago, as we heard yesterday.
Together with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, we <unk> bacteria designed to capture rapidly carbon from the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we have been able to generate structures that make their transition without problems and <unk> and if it broadens even more, <unk>
A <unk> tree <unk>
Working with an old material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water, and with a little bit of synthetic biology, we've transformed a structure from <unk> of shrimp in an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here's the best <unk> for objects designed to <unk> in the sea, <unk> life and put on the ground, they'll grow a tree.
The fit for our next exploration using the same design principles was the solar system.
We're looking for the possibility of making clothes to keep life <unk>
To do that, we need to dominate the bacteria and control its flow.
So as the Blank <unk> did our own table of <unk> new forms of life created <unk> made <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I like to think of synthetic biology like the liquid <unk> only that instead of <unk> metals -- it would be <unk> new biological features inside very small channels inside of channels in very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
<unk> our own 3D channels to control the flow of these <unk> <unk> crops.
In our first piece of clothes, they were <unk> two <unk>
The first is <unk>
It lives in our oceans and in the <unk> fresh water.
And the second, E. <unk> the bacteria that <unk> in the human intestine.
One becomes the light, the other <unk> sugar and produces useful biofuels, for the built environment.
But these two <unk> don't interact in nature.
In fact, they never <unk>
They're here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship on a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not by natural selection, but evolution design.
In order to contain these relationships, we've created a single channel that looks like the vocal tract that will help you <unk> these bacteria and to <unk> their function of path.
So we started to grow those channels in the human body, <unk> the properties of the material according to computational <unk>
If we wanted more <unk> <unk>
This <unk> <unk> system, when it stretch out from one end to another, it looks at 60 feet.
This is half the length of a football field, and 10 times more than our own <unk>
And here it is, as <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> brilliant channels in your clothes.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are growing creatures, only half is <unk>
What if design would provide the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that increase the <unk>
And if we could create personal <unk> that we <unk> our skin -- <unk> the neurological tissue and <unk> our <unk>
Think of this as a way of editing biology.
I call this the material ecology.
For that, you always have to go back to nature.
And so now you know that a 3D printer actually <unk> <unk>
It also knows that nature doesn't do that.
<unk> <unk> with <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture.
<unk> is not going to be on this level of <unk>
It does it through the combination of two materials, but of two proteins in different <unk>
One acts as a structure, the other is the glue or the matrix, <unk> those fibers in each other.
And this happens across scales.
The silk worm first gets into the environment, creates a <unk> structure, and then it starts to <unk> a cocoon of compression.
The tension and <unk> the two forces of life, is shown in a single material.
In order to understand better how this complex process works, we attach a little magnet to the head of a silk worm to <unk>
We put it inside a box with magnetic sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of dots in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of the cocoon of the silk <unk>
However, when we put the silk worm on a flat patch of <unk> not within a box, we realized that we would <unk> a cocoon and still <unk> <unk>
So we started designing different parts of different parts -- different <unk> and we've discovered that the form, the composition, the structure of the <unk> is <unk> directly by the environment.
Often the silk worms are often <unk> to death in their <unk> its silk <unk> and used in the <unk> industry.
We saw that designing these templates we can shape <unk> silk without boiling a single <unk>
It <unk> <unk> and we could create these things.
So we climbed this process up to the architectural scale.
We had a robot <unk> making silk <unk> and we put ourselves on our site.
We knew that silk worms were <unk> to the darkest areas and <unk> so we use a solar <unk> diagram to reveal the distribution of light and heat in our structure.
So we created holes or <unk> to block the rays from light and the heat worms to silk worms on the structure.
We were ready to get <unk>
We were asking for silk worms to a silk farm online.
And after <unk> four weeks, they were prepared to be <unk> with us.
We put them carefully at the bottom of the <unk> and while <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and life begins again, like us, but much, much shorter short.
<unk> Fuller said that tension is great integrity, and he was right.
By <unk> biological silk about silk <unk> they give all this <unk> of our integrity.
And in a little more than two or three weeks, we <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In a curious symmetry, this is also the length of the <unk> <unk>
The <unk> after the <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 additional <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A silk <unk> is using a robotic arm, the other full <unk>
If the last frontier of design is to give life to the products and the buildings around us, to form an ecology of two materials, the designers should bring these two visions of the world.
Which brings us back, of course, at the beginning.
Here's a new era of design, a new age of creation, which leads to a design inspired by nature to a nature inspired by design, which demands us, for the first time, we take care of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Hands up if you've ever wondered what you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember how old they were when they asked them for the first time this?
You can <unk> with your fingers.
Three. Five. Three. Five. Five.
Now, raise your hand if the question is, "What do you want to be <unk>
It has caused them some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who could never answer the question "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem was not that I didn't have any interest, but I had <unk>
In the school, I liked the English <unk> and the art and making websites -- I also played the guitar in a rock band called <unk> <unk>
You may have heard of us.
And in general, I like to test and persist in anyway, for having spent a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But over time, this feeling of <unk> this feeling of this -- this is no longer a challenge, it comes to <unk>
And I have to give it up.
But then I'm going to tell you about something else, something totally different, and I got involved in it, and I let myself absorb and feel <unk> I've found <unk> and then again this point where I start to <unk>
And finally, I want to give it up.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This pattern made me a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first was because I wasn't sure how I was going to turn this all into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, to deny all my other passions and <unk> to <unk>
Another reason why made me so much anxiety was a little bit more personal.
I was worried that there was something bad about this, and something wrong with me for nothing.
I was worried to be afraid of engagement, or to be dispersed, or to <unk> or my own success.
If you can relate my story and these feelings, I would like to ask you something that I'd like to ask myself to put back then.
<unk> themselves, where they learned to allocate the meaning of bad or abnormal to do things.
I'm going to tell you where they do it, they learned about the culture.
You ask first ask first question: "What do you want to be <unk>
When we have about five years.
And the truth is that no one cares about what they <unk> at that age.
It's considered a naive question to cause cute answers in children like, <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> or want to be <unk>
<unk> the <unk> of <unk> here.
This question is happening over and over again as we grow in different ways, <unk> <unk> to high school students, you ask them to pick up in college.
And at some point, "What do you want to be <unk>
It happens to be the cute exercise before what the dream takes to us.
Why?
If this question is inspired by children to dream with what they might be, not inspired to dream with everything they might be.
In fact, it does right in the contrary, because when somebody asks you what you want to be, you can't respond to 20 different things, but even adults <unk> and say, "Oh, what nice is it, but you can't be <unk> <unk> and <unk>
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  and he's <unk> <unk>
And this Amy <unk> editor turned into <unk> <unk> teacher and <unk>
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
All you hear is they are going to have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The notion of life is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of fate or the real <unk> the idea that every one of us has something to do during their time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing is and dedicate your life to it.
But if you're somebody who is not connected in this way?
What if there are lots of different issues that wake up your curiosity and lots of different things that wants to do?
There's no place for someone like one in that framework.
And so you can feel it.
You can feel that you don't have a goal.
And feel like there's something wrong with you.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You're a <unk>
A <unk> is somebody with many interests and creative activities.
It's a breath to say.
It could help if you divide it into three different <unk> potential and <unk>
You can also use other terms that you would take the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
During the age of the Renaissance age, the ideal was who was <unk> in multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as <unk>
It <unk> any term you like or <unk> your own.
It seems like a species of adapt to a community, we can't agree with an identity.
It's easy to see <unk> as limitation or <unk> that you should win.
But what I've learned about talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there's huge strengths in this way.
So here are three <unk>
One, the synthesis of ideas.
I mean, the combination of two or more fields and creating something new in the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> their shared interests in cartography, visualization of data, travel, math and design, when I found <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates <unk> <unk>
And <unk> and Rachel came up with this unique idea by its <unk> of skills and experiences.
Innovation happens at intersections.
So the new ideas come from?
And the <unk> with all their background can access a lot of these points of <unk>
The second <unk> superpower is learning quickly.
When we <unk> it for something, we're going to do that.
We look at everything we can have in our hands.
We're used to <unk> because it was a lot of times in the past, and this means that we are less afraid to test things and get out of our comfort.
A lot of skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring everything we've learned to every new area that we <unk> so we rarely start from zero.
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> full-time <unk>
As a girl piano <unk> an incredible capacity to develop the muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest <unk>
Before he became a writer, <unk> was <unk> financial <unk>
He had to learn the highest performance mechanics when its practices began to write their practices and this ability to help to write compelling launches for the editors.
<unk> is rarely a waste of time to go to what you're going to tell you -- even if at the end of the end, it will <unk>
It's possible to apply that knowledge in a completely different field, in a way that you couldn't have <unk>
The third <unk> <unk> is adaptability. It's the ability to transform anything that is needed in a <unk> situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes director of videos, other online designer designer -- sometimes consultant as a Kickstarter, sometimes teacher, and sometimes, apparently, James <unk>
It's valuable because it does a good job.
He is even more valuable because it can take different <unk> depending on the needs of their clients.
<unk> <unk> Company as the most important skill for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so rapidly and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that can <unk> to meet the needs of the market, which really <unk>
<unk> of ideas, fast learning and <unk> three skills where <unk> are very <unk> and three skills that you could lose if they're pushed to reduce their goals.
As a society, we have a huge interest in encouraging <unk> to be themselves.
We have complex, <unk> problems, right now, and we need creative creative thinkers to deal with them.
Let's say they are, in your heart, <unk>
<unk> <unk> knowing that they wanted to be <unk> <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you.
In fact, some of the best teams get up from a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
<unk> can dive in depth and put ideas in practice, and the <unk> provides a amplitude of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all design lives and careers that we can relate to how we're connected.
And unfortunately, to <unk> most of them are told to be more like their fellow <unk>
And once said this, if there's one thing you will take from this talk, I hope it's this: <unk> with internal <unk> whatever it is.
If you are a heart teacher, then, <unk> for all the media.
That's where you give the best of it.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those who just turned out to be one of them in the last 12 minutes,  I say, <unk> with their many passions.
Follow his curiosity for those <unk>
They will take the intersections.
<unk> our inner wiring takes us to a more authentic and happy life.
And perhaps most importantly, we <unk> the world is <unk>
Thank you.
In <unk> a woman called <unk> they took her to a psychiatric <unk>
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't even remember the most basic details of their life.
His doctor was called <unk>
I didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> for her until unfortunately, passed away from <unk>
After his death, <unk> did a <unk> and they found weird <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> brain, of a guy who had never seen before.
The most amazing thing is even more.
If you were going to have been living today, we could not be able to give it more help than he <unk> gave him <unk> years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's disease.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient to get a diagnosis that we now call Alzheimer's disease.
Since <unk> medicine has moved a lot.
They have discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from the <unk> many treatments for the cancer -- <unk> for HIV, <unk> for <unk> and much more.
But little has been moved on the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
I'm part of a team of scientists working to find a cure for Alzheimer's disease for more than a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's now affects 40 million around the world.
But by 2050, it will affect 150 million which, by the way, to include many of you.
If they expect to live up to 85 years or more, the possibility of Alzheimer's will be almost one of each two of them.
In other words, there is the likelihood that it takes up their <unk> with Alzheimer's or helping to take care of a friend or being dear to Alzheimer's disease.
In the United States, Alzheimer's health costs cost 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of healthcare is spent on Alzheimer's disease.
Today is the most expensive disease and its costs -- a <unk> increase in 2050, as they <unk> the generation of <unk> boom.
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the biggest medical challenges and social challenges of our generation.
But it has been relatively little to <unk>
Today, one of the first 10 causes of death from all over the world, Alzheimer's is the only one that cannot be <unk> or not slow its development.
We understand less than Alzheimer's disease than other diseases because we've invested less time and money in the research itself.
The U.S. government spends 10 times as much every year in cancer research in Alzheimer's disease despite the fact that we have cost Alzheimer's disease and causes a single annual number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a fundamental cause, the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what few people knows, but all the world's world, Alzheimer's is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last <unk> years, all of the scientists, <unk> Alzheimer's with aging.
We think that will be <unk> in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But you just have to look at a picture of a medical brain in comparison with a healthy patient to see the actual physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to trigger a severe loss of memory and mental skills, the damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer's reduces significantly life expectancy and it's always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found plates and <unk> in the <unk> brain.
For almost a century, we didn't know a lot about this.
We know today that are made of protein molecules.
You can think of a protein molecule like a piece of paper that folds up as an origami.
There are places in the paper that are <unk>
And when it folds up, these <unk> dots end up inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some <unk> dots stay out of the outside.
This makes the protein molecules <unk> each other, forming groups that can form large plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are many steps, and the identification of what to block is complex, like <unk> a bomb.
<unk> a cable could do nothing.
<unk> others can make the bomb <unk>
You have to find the right step that we would do, and then create a drug that it does.
Until recently, in his biggest part of the wires and waited the best.
But now there is a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, <unk> physical, physicists and mathematicians.
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process. Now you're testing a new kind of drugs that are <unk> specifically this step to stop the disease.
I'm going to show you some of our last results.
No one out of our lab has seen it yet.
Let's look at a few videos of what happened when we test these drugs in <unk>
These are the healthy worms -- and you can see that they move with normal.
These worms are on the other hand, they have protein molecules that are stuck in each other inside them, like in humans with Alzheimer's disease.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But by giving our new drugs to these worms in a early stage, then we see that <unk> and live normal life.
This is just a good initial result of it, but research as this shows that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years of wait, there's real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But to get that hope, from overcoming Alzheimer's disease, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We have to ensure that Alzheimer's is a disease and that if we <unk> it can be <unk>
In the case of other diseases, the patients and their families have <unk> more research and <unk> pressure on governments, drug industry and <unk>
That was essential to move forward in HIV treatment in the late 1980s.
Today we see that same unit to beat cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't speak for themselves.
And their families, the hidden victims of their loved ones day and night, they're often too <unk> to get out and advocate for change.
So it really depends on you.
Alzheimer's is not, in most cases a genetic disease.
Everybody with a brain runs at risk.
Today, there are 40 million patients like <unk> who can't create the change that they need for themselves.
<unk> talking for them, and help demand a cure.
Thank you.
I put this article in the spinal column in the New York Times, in January of this year.
To fall in love with love to do this.
The paper is about a psychological study designed to create romantic love in the laboratory, and my own experience when I test it as a night of last summer.
So the procedure is pretty simple: two strangers will be <unk> to become more personal and more personal and more personal questions, and then they're both looking at the eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions.
Number <unk> If you could wake up tomorrow tomorrow with one quality or skill, what would that be?
Number <unk> When was the last time you hit another person?
And <unk>
These are getting more personal and more personal lives.
Number <unk> <unk> really <unk> me, <unk> your partner what you like from him or her -- I'm very honest about this time, and I gave things that you don't say to someone you've just known.
When I came across this study a few years ago, a detail really struck me the attention that two of the participants had married six months later, and invited all of the lab to <unk>
So, it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course, I was also <unk>
And when I had a chance to test this study, with someone who knew not particularly good, I didn't expect to <unk>
However, we were <unk> and --  And I thought it was a good story, so I sent it to the <unk> column a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it's already <unk> so I guess some of you are probably asking for some of you are probably asking them together.
And the reason I think you challenge this is because they've done this question over and over again in the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to that.
A week before I published the article was very nervous.
I had been working on a romantic book in the last few years, so I had invited myself to write about my experience in romantic love on my blog.
But a blog entry can come to some hundreds of views like a lot, and those were usually just my Facebook friends and imagined that my article in the New York Times would have probably a few thousand views.
And that hit a good burden of attention in a relatively new relationship.
But I had no idea.
The paper ran on a Friday night, and on Saturday, this happened in the traffic of my blog.
And on Sunday, I had already called the "Today Show and Good <unk> <unk>
In a month, the paper got over eight million <unk> and I was, for saying something, a little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to encourage trust writing with radical experiences -- but another thing is to discover that life loving one has been international news --  -- and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people called the <unk> what they did every day for weeks, always, they asked the same question: They still keep together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I made a quick search for my email <unk> with the phrase, <unk> still <unk>
A lot of messages came up immediately.
They were from students and journalists and strangers like this.
I was interviewed at radio and <unk>
Even, I gave a talk, and a woman screamed at the stage, "Hey <unk> <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately put in red.
I understand this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship, you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
But I was not prepared for the <unk> of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to be <unk> life.
In fact, the New York Times published an article <unk> for St. <unk> that included the experiences of the readers by testing the study in them with different degrees of success.
So my first impulse to all this attention was very <unk> with my own relationship.
I said not to every request that we both have to do a public emergence together.
<unk> TV interviews, and <unk> orders of pictures of us two.
I think I was afraid to become the icons of the <unk> of the <unk> process, a range of which I didn't feel like at all.
And I understand that people didn't want to know if the study worked, they wanted to know if they really <unk> I mean, if I was able to produce love -- not just an adventure, but real love, love <unk>
But this was a question I didn't feel able to respond.
My relationship was just a few months ago, and I felt, especially the wrong question.
How do you know if you put together or not, and also <unk>
If the answer was not, it would make the experience of doing these 36 questions.
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions in this same study in 1997. And there, the goal of the researcher was not to produce romantic love.
Instead, I was looking for interpersonal approach, among college students, using what <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
It sounds romantic, right?
But the study did work.
The participants felt more close after doing that, several <unk> studies, they also used the <unk> protocol <unk> as a fast way to create trust and interaction between strangers.
They've been used among members of the police and the community, and they've used it among people on the opposite of <unk>
The original version of the story, which I tried last summer, that combines personal questions with four minutes of eye contact, was cited in this piece, but unfortunately never published it.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk in a little liberal arts college, and then a student came up to me and told me with <unk> <unk> the studio and didn't work.
He seemed to be <unk> by it.
And I said, "You want to tell you about the person who <unk>
Well he made a pause.
I think she just wants to be friends.
I said, but became better friends?
<unk> I know they were able to get better to test the <unk>
The <unk>
So, <unk> I said.
However, I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you are looking for when it comes to love.
I stumbled across the first time when I was 29, and I was going through a really hard <unk>
I had had that relationship since I had 20, which was essentially all my adult life, and he was my first real love, and I had no idea how or if I could live without him.
So I took to science.
And so I did all that I could find on the science of romantic love, and I expected that to be able to sort of save the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the moment I thought just to research for the book I write but in retrospect, it seems to really be <unk>
I thought that if I was <unk> with the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel so bad and I used to feel like I sat then.
And all of this knowledge has been useful in one other way.
I'm more patient with love. I'm more <unk>
I have more confidence to demand what I'm after.
But I can also see me more clearly, and I can realize that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than reasonably much more than you can to demand me.
What I'm looking for love is an assurance not just to be <unk> today and being <unk> tomorrow, but remain <unk> in the person I love.
It may be the guarantee that the guarantee that people ask when they wanted to know if we were still together.
The story that the media was told about 36 questions is that there can be a shortcut to <unk>
There may be a way in a way to mitigate some of the <unk> risk, and this is a very <unk> story because in love makes us feel beautifully, but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it comes to the love, we're very willing to accept the short version of the story.
The story of the story that says, "We still together?
And his content with a <unk> response, or No.
So more than a question, <unk> that we ask questions, questions like, how do you decide who deserves your love and who isn't it?
How do you stay in love with things like this, and how to know when to cut and <unk>
How do you live with uncertainty that inevitably leads to a relationship? Or even more, how you live with doubt about your <unk>
I don't necessarily know the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good beginning to have a more <unk> conversation about what to love somebody.
So if you want the short version of my relationship, it's <unk> a year ago, a known one, and we applied a study designed to create romantic love, we still follow together, and I'm very <unk>
But fall in love is not the same thing to stay <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my article. The love didn't happen.
<unk> in love because we take the choice to be.
And I kind of <unk> it now, not because it's not true, but because at the time, I hadn't considered everything that we were supposed to be.
I didn't think of how many times we would have both to take that decision, and how long it will have to keep doing that choice without knowing before he always chose or not.
I want it to be enough to have done and <unk> 36 questions, having chosen to love somebody so generous, kind of fun and fun and <unk> that choice in the largest daily newspaper.
But what I've done, instead is turning my relationship to the kind of myth that I don't really believe.
And what I think about, and what maybe I'm going to spend my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want the happy ending implicit in the title of my paper, which is, by the way, the only part of the article that I actually didn't write about.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to love someone, and the hope that he also love, and it's <unk> but that's <unk> but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by a <unk> <unk> and in a way, I got a <unk> of the forest.
And the city of New York was a time --  -- something that really affected me, but more details later on.
I'll start with when I was eight years old.
I took a wooden box and <unk> a dollar, a dollar, a dollar, and a fork in her somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought that some strangers or some aliens would find this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our species <unk> ideas, for example how we eat <unk>
I had no idea.
Anyway, it has grace because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still doing boxes.
At a moment I was in <unk> <unk> I like to go from ride and <unk> and all of those things, and I was doing a collage for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took all the pages and I took all the pages and I made a kind of <unk> <unk> the <unk> I covered it and a bee was <unk>
Well, my mother is afraid of bees and she is <unk> to them, so I added more resin on the canvas, thinking I could <unk>
Instead, it happened the opposite: somehow it seemed to increase the size of size, as if it was that I would take the text with a <unk>
So I did I I built more boxes.
This time, I started to add electronic elements, frogs strange bottles that I would find on the street, everything I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to <unk> and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that God can draw in space.
I can flow you -- I can just draw just like you do about a dead body, a crime scene.
And I took out the objects and created my own taxonomy of specimens <unk>
First, <unk> that you can get an idea.
Then I made some insects and weird creatures.
It was really fun to draw on the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibits and those things, and I was making some money, to bring my girlfriend to dinner, for example, going to <unk>
It was really cool.
At some point I became interested in the human form, sculptures of natural size with pictures of human beings inside the layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I <unk>
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill me.
And I went to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing on the glass, similar similar to the drawing on a window, then the other window, and the other window, and it had all these windows together that form a three-dimensional composition of three-dimensional composition in it.
And this really works and so I could stop using <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work was done with something very big, I call <unk>
For the <unk> I was inspired by the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> which is a painting in the Museum of <unk> in Spain.
Do you know?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little ahead of their time.
Well, the <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 11 pounds.
<unk> feet long.
It's twice as they're 10 meters of composition.
It's kind of weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left, it's Jesus and the <unk>
There's a cave where all these creatures with animals are moving between two worlds.
They're going to be the world of representation -- this <unk> mesh <unk> where they <unk>
This is where the creatures with animals are headed by <unk> ready for suicide <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is a bird being tied to a <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> The <unk> -- the <unk> platform of the <unk> <unk> the shelter of Osama bin Laden, there are all kinds of weird stuff that you can find if you look very well in the ocean.
In all ways, a kind of <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits out oil in a hand while from the other hand they come out and clouds.
Their hands are like <unk> and it seems to be <unk> that holds the Earth and the cosmos in balance.
So this is one aspect of <unk>
It's a little story.
That's the hand in which we <unk>
And then, when you go on the other hand, you have a <unk> like a <unk> <unk> and it spits out <unk>
It also has a <unk> tail, it also has a <unk> tail that joins the <unk>
Anyway, its tail turn into the <unk> on a <unk>
I don't know why it happened.
Things that go through you know.
His tail ends up in a <unk> <unk> <unk> made from 1986.
They have <unk>
They did in the 1980s, as if they were baseball cards of the terrorists.
Very <unk> at the time.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
This is a six year-old project to make 100 of these human beings.
Each one is an archive of our culture, through media and material or <unk> dictionaries or magazines.
But each one acts as a kind of archive in a human being, and they travel in groups of 20, four or 12 to the same time.
They're like cells, they come together, they are <unk>
And you can walk between them. I'm getting years old.
Each one is basically a <unk> microscope that weighs 1,300 pounds of one being trapped inside of it.
This has a little cave on the chest.
That's the <unk> it's on the chest, you can get <unk>
I'm going to play you for the rest of the body -- there's a waterfall coming out of the chest, and you cover the penis or <unk> or whatever it is, a kind of <unk> thing.
It's a quick refresher on these works because I can't <unk> for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a broken body in half.
This has two heads and they're communicating between the two.
There are some pills that come out and enter the head of this strange statue there.
There's a little scene inside the <unk> <unk>
Can you imagine?
Anyway, this talk is about these <unk> like the boxes that we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick box. It's called <unk> <unk>
In this box there is a physical, a neuroscientist, a neuroscientist, a musician, a musician a musician -- a <unk> a <unk> a <unk> an publishing arm that spreads all the content we do in the world and a garden.
<unk> the box and all of the people in it occupy each other as particles.
And I think that's the way we change the world.
When you <unk> who is and the box that you're living in.
And together we get to realize that we're all together in this, that this illusion that we are different, these concepts of countries, of the borders, of religion, it doesn't work.
We're all very facts about the same stuff and in the same box.
And if we don't start exchanging those things with sweetness and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do you do when it hurts your head?
They take a <unk>
But for this pill to actually have the pain, first goes through the stomach, the <unk> and other organs.
It's going to take a pill is the most effective system and <unk> so that any drug is <unk> in the body.
The <unk> though, is that by <unk> any drug is <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in patients with HIV.
When you take drugs -- these are <unk> they serve the amount of viruses in your blood and increase the heart of <unk> cells.
But they are also known for its side effects, <unk> in its large majority of negative, because in the time that it takes to get to the white <unk> it gets <unk> and worse even for the time that it takes to get to your fate, which is where it's most important in the <unk> of HIV.
These are regions of the body like the <unk> <unk> the nervous system, the lungs, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't easily go into the blood stream of the patients who are <unk> to regular therapy with antiretroviral drugs.
However, after the disruption of the treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new cells.
This is the big problem of HIV treatment with current drugs that are a treatment for life run by the oral <unk>
One day, I sat down and I thought, <unk> making the treatment directly into the warehouse of the virus, without the risk of <unk>
As a scientific scientist in <unk> the answer was in front of me: <unk> of course.
If you use them in <unk> for <unk> and <unk> and diabetes surgery can be used for anything else -- including the drug <unk>
In fact, we're already using pulses of laser to open up or drill extremely small holes that open and closed almost immediately the cells infected with HIV to introduce drugs.
You ask the best people to ask, "How is that <unk>
We sent a small and powerful laser beam on the cell cell infected with HIV while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser cuts through the cell, while the cell absorbs the drug in a matter of microseconds.
Before you even notice, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're currently testing this technology in vitro or on <unk> plates, but the goal is to bring this technology into the human body, applying it to the human body.
"How is that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is, through a <unk> device.
With the first head, it's our laser, which is our laser, we're going to do a <unk> on the site of infection.
The second head, which is a camera, heads to the site of infection.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> that distributes the drug, it releases it directly into the site of infection, while the laser is used again to keep the open cells.
Well, this doesn't seem a lot of time.
But one day, if you succeed, this technology can lead to total HIV <unk>
Yeah. A cure for HIV.
This is the <unk> dream of <unk> in our case, a laser treatment.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've been studying armed groups not <unk> armed organizations like terrorists, insurgents or <unk>
<unk> what these groups do when they're not <unk>
My goal is to understand a better understanding of these agents of violence and study ways of encouraging the transition of violent involvement to violent <unk>
I do field work, in the world of politics and the library.
Understanding these groups is key to solving most of course, because the war has changed.
It used to be a dispute between states.
Not anymore.
Now it's a conflict between states and actors.
For example, of the <unk> peace arrangements between 1975, and 2011, <unk> had signed up between a state and a non-governmental actor.
So we need to understand these <unk> we have even <unk> or <unk> in any process of successful conflict resolution.
But how do you do it?
We have to know what it motivates these organizations.
We know very well the reasons why they do it, but no one can figure out what they do when they don't <unk>
The armed struggle and the political struggle was <unk>
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global vision.
<unk> groups today are complex organizations.
For example, <unk> <unk> known for its violent <unk> against Israel.
From its creation in 1980, <unk> has also established a political game, a network of social services and a military device.
Similarly, the Palestinian <unk> known for her attacks against suicide attacks against Israel, also runs the <unk> of Gaza since 2007.
So these groups make them more than just shooting.
They're multitasking people.
He <unk> a complex machine, <unk> radio channels -- TV channels and online websites and strategies in social networks.
And here they have the print magazine in English and published to <unk>
The armed groups are also investing in a complex fundraising <unk> but through business <unk> for example, construction companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their <unk> to recruit and build their brand.
<unk> also do something else: they create stronger ties with their population investing in social services.
They build schools, they run hospitals, they put professional training programs or <unk>
<unk> offers all these services and more.
The armed groups also try to conquer the population by offering something that the state will not <unk> security and protection.
The ascent of the Taliban locked in Afghanistan or even the beginning of the <unk> <unk> can be able to understand the efforts of these groups to provide safety.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has a low price rate for the population.
But in general, to provide social services, means to fill in a vacuum -- a <unk> gap for the government, and allows these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the election victory in 2006 of the Palestinian Hamas cannot be understood without recognizing the social work of the group.
It's a really complex stage, even in the West, when we look at <unk> groups just think about the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, strategy or long-term vision.
These groups are hybrid groups.
<unk> because they fill gaps in the government, and they come together like armed groups and political groups participate in the violent struggle and give governance.
And the more complex and sophisticated organizations are these organizations, fewer can be <unk> as opposed to a state.
How do you call a group like <unk>
<unk> a little bit of a territory, running all its functions.
It's a state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states, of nations without state and hybrids and the more weak the states, like in the Middle East -- more <unk> and fill that gap the <unk> actors.
This is important to governments, because to counter these groups will have to invest more in the military tools.
We <unk> that emptiness of government has to be at the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and create peace.
If we understand better <unk> we will understand better what incentives offer to encourage the transition from violence to nonviolent violence.
In this new <unk> between states and <unk> actors, military power is able to win some battle, but we will not give us peace and stability.
In order to achieve these goals we need long-term investment to fill that security, of security, to fill that vacuum of government that allowed these groups to thrive in a principle.
Thank you.
I'm a failure as a woman and as a feminist.
My opinions about gender equality are <unk> but I'm afraid to take openly the label <unk> would be unfair for the <unk>
I'm a <unk> but quite bad.
And so I would describe it as a bad feminist.
Or, at least, I wrote a paper, and a book called "The <unk> <unk> and then in the interviews, people started to call me <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke meant to me and a <unk> <unk> has become a bigger thing.
Let me give you a step back.
When I was a young man, especially in my youth and 20 years old, I had strange ideas about the <unk> these women <unk> <unk> with the men and they would have sex. Like that was a bad thing.
Today, I see how women are treated all around the world and anger, in particular, seems a perfectly reasonable response.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that was using people to <unk> that might be a feminist.
It will be labeled as a feminist was a <unk> a <unk>
I <unk> like a woman who doesn't follow the rules, which is asking too much, with <unk> and <unk> to believe that it's equal to a man.
Nobody wants to be that woman <unk> until you realize that it's actually that woman and can't imagine being another person.
Over time, as I grew up, I started accepting that I am, in fact, <unk> and also proud to be.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
<unk> the same self for the same work.
We have a right to travel around the world as <unk> free or violence.
We have a right to use its easy way and accessible the contraceptives and services to <unk>
We have the right to decide about our bodies, no need for <unk> controls or doctrines of <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you have to have in account our other <unk>
We're not only women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and <unk> our social condition, skills and much more.
We need to be in account these differences and how we behave in the same way that we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our feminism is not anything.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear, I'm a mess.
I'm full of contradictions.
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist.
I have another confession.
When I lead to work, I listen to rap music -- it's all volume.
Though the letter <unk> to women and offends me deeply, the classic <unk> <unk> of the yin of yang <unk> is amazing.
Do you actually have your <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> until you get <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I'm completely <unk> by my musical <unk>
I firmly believe in the work of man, which is all I don't want to do, <unk> --  all the <unk> tasks -- but also killing insects, the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The pink is my favorite color.
<unk> of fashion magazines and the nice things.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have erotic fantasies of the fairy tales that make a reality.
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt his husband, it's her choice, and I'm not who for <unk>
If a woman decides to stay home to raise her children, I accepted that choice, too.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable through this same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> so that women are economically vulnerable when they <unk>
<unk> this problem.
<unk> the conventional feminism that's ignored or <unk> historically the needs of women of color women -- the gay workers, the gay workers, <unk> <unk> and high school.
Listen, if that's good feminism is a very bad feminist -- I'm a very bad feminist here.
It also happens by this: <unk> <unk> I feel a lot of <unk>
We have this tendency to <unk> <unk> in a <unk>
We hope that it will be <unk>
When we <unk> the <unk> with a lot of taste from the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I already consider myself to <unk> that <unk> before you try to put myself there.
<unk> women, particularly innovative and leaders of the sector, are afraid to be tagged as <unk>
They are afraid to stand up and say, "Yes, I'm <unk> I'm afraid of what that tag is <unk> for fear of not being able to fulfill the <unk>
Let's take an example to <unk> or like I call it.
In the last few years, it's a feminist <unk>
In <unk> Music <unk> 2014, in <unk> <unk> in front of the word <unk>
It was a show -- to see this pop star will take openly feminism and to know women and young men who will be feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> the time, cultural critics started <unk> whether it was <unk> or not a feminist.
<unk> his feminism, instead of simply believing the word of an adult woman and <unk>
<unk> perfection <unk> because we're still struggling for a lot, we want a lot, we need so much <unk>
We're going to be far beyond <unk> and <unk> to <unk> the feminism of any woman, <unk> until it's nothing left.
We don't need to do that.
The bad feminism, or more <unk> <unk> is <unk>
But what happens next?
We decided to recognize our <unk> to give the action and to be a little bit more <unk>
If I hear music, I am creating a demand for artists to be happier and happy providing a <unk> supply.
These artists will not change their way to talk about women in their songs until they <unk> change actually affecting their profits.
It's certainly hard.
Why has his music that will be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a worse choice.
But when bad decisions they justify this makes it more difficult for women to achieve equality, the equality that we all deserve and is our responsibility.
I think of my <unk> <unk>
These are two <unk> <unk> and brilliant, and very brave. I want them to grow in a world.
<unk> because of the strong creatures they are.
I think of them, all of a sudden, the best option <unk> as something much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program is dealing with sexual violence against women like sports, <unk> the <unk> play.
We can change the radio <unk> when we hear songs that treat women like nothing.
We can spend our money to go to the cinema in another part when movies don't deal with women as well as <unk> objects.
We can stop supporting the professional sports sports where athletes treat their fellow <unk> as <unk>
In any case, men, especially young men men -- heterosexual men can say, "No, I'm not going to publish on their magazine, engaging in their project, or working with you, until you don't have enough of women, so much to participate in the way to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your desk or your organization is more <unk> with a wider range of people."
Those of us who are <unk> but <unk> to participate in this kind of projects, we can also <unk> it to be even more like us to overcome the barriers to the <unk>
Because we're not <unk> <unk> without these efforts, without taking these <unk> our achievements will mean very little.
We can make these little courage and hope that our decisions will come to the top, to the people in the power directors and producers of cinema and music, <unk> <unk> people who can make very large decisions, more courageous, to create a durable and significant change.
We can also claim our feminism, -- good, bad, or <unk>
The last line of my book <unk> <unk> says, <unk> being a bad feminist will not be a <unk>
This is true because of many reasons, but I say, especially because I <unk> my voice was <unk> me and feminism helped me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it incident to deal with what happened.
Some guys would tell me when I was too young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
They treated me as if it was nothing.
I started to believe that it was nothing.
I <unk> my voice, and after everything I didn't think about to believe that I might say something that might matter.
But I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I <unk> in a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and the women who looked like me and understood what it meant to live in this world if you have the brown skin.
I read the words of the women who showed me that it was not anything.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through writing and feminism, as I also found out that if I was a little brave other woman could hear me and see me and see that none of us is nothing that the world is about telling us that we are.
In a hand, I have the power to achieve anything.
And in the other, I argue the <unk> reality that I'm just a woman.
I'm a bad <unk> I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my thinking to think, what I say and what I do, without abandoning everything that makes me human.
I hope we all can do the same thing.
I hope that we all can be a little courageous, when you need such a <unk>
Right after Christmas last year, I was <unk> children in California had <unk> to have visited <unk> or to be exposed to someone who had been there.
The virus then went through the border with Canada, <unk> over 100 children in <unk>
One of the <unk> things of this outbreak is that <unk> that can be terrible for a child with an immune immune system is one of the most easily <unk> diseases in the world.
There is a effective vaccine against this for over half a century -- but many of the children involved in the <unk> outbreak had not been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something allegedly <unk> the autism.
But a moment, it wasn't the article that unleashed the argument about autism and vaccines and <unk> and <unk> and marked by being a <unk> fraud by the British Medical School.
It doesn't believe most of the smart scientists that vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know, but millions of fathers all over the world are still <unk> that vaccines put in danger to their children of having autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the estimates of autism in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism considered a very strange disease.
And the few psychologists and realizing that I had heard of her believed to develop his professional life without seeing one case.
For decades, the estimates of prevalence followed stable only three or four children for every 10,000 <unk>
But then, in the 1990s, the numbers started <unk>
<unk> of fundraising <unk> refer to routinely autism as an epidemic as if I could <unk> from another child in <unk>
What's going on?
If you're not vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people from the Centers for Disease Control Center in Atlanta -- they tend to based on phrases like <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> to explain these <unk> figures.
But that type of language doesn't <unk> a lot of the fears of a young mother who seeks in the face of his son of two years, the visual contact.
If the diagnostic criteria had to be <unk> why they were so <unk>
Why were those cases as hard to find before the decade of <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened is that I had less to do with the slow progress and <unk> progress of science that with the key <unk>
For most of the 20th century, doctors told a story about what autism and how it was discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact on global public health.
There was a second most accurate story of autism that had been lost and forgotten in the dark corner of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us all about how we get here and where we have to go.
The first story begins with a child psychiatrist Leo <unk> at Johns Hopkins Hospital in <unk> <unk> published an article that describes 11 young patients who looked like <unk> worlds they were <unk> even to their own parents.
They could have fun for hours by waving their hands in their faces, but they were <unk> of panic as when they didn't put their favorite toy in his usual place without knowing them.
Over the basis of the patients treated in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very rare.
For the 1950s, as the main authority of the world in the subject, I stated that I had seen less than 150 true cases of his syndrome as <unk> <unk> of places as far as South Africa.
This is actually no wonder, because the criteria of <unk> for autism diagnosis were very <unk>
For example, <unk> will give that diagnosis to <unk> but now we know that <unk> is very common in autism.
Once it was <unk> that he had become nine out of 10 children sent by other doctors to her doctor's office, without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of his theories were not <unk>
It <unk> autism as a form of <unk> caused by cold parents, and <unk>
These kids, he said, they kept very carefully in a fridge that doesn't <unk>
At the same time, though, I noticed that some of their young people had special skills that cluster in certain areas like music, mathematics and memory.
One of the kids in their clinic could distinguish between 18 <unk> before I turned the two years.
When her mother put one of his favorite records he said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills, affirming things like the children were just <unk> what they had heard of their parents <unk> desperate to win their <unk>
As a result, autism became a source of shame for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own well, becoming invisible to the world in general.
Amazingly, it wasn't until the 1970s that researchers started testing the theory of <unk> that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> a cognitive psychologist in London, thought that the theory of mothers <unk> was pretty stupid.
She and her husband John was warm and warm and <unk> and they had a deep autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a girl like black-eyed Susie! No special education, and no access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To defend from the National Service, they needed more resources for autistic children and their families, <unk> and his colleague Judith <unk> decided to do something that should have done 30 years before.
They launched a study of autism prevalence in the general population.
He <unk> a suburb of London called <unk> to try to find kids autistic in the community.
What you saw was that the <unk> model was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more <unk> and diverse <unk>
Some kids couldn't speak at all, whereas others were <unk> in their fascination with astrophysics, in dinosaurs or <unk>
Otherwise, these children didn't fit in beautiful <unk> and <unk> as they said, and they saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have predicted.
At first, they were lost to try to make sense of his data.
How did no one noticed these children before?
But then <unk> I found a reference to a paper published in German in <unk> the next year to the <unk> item and then <unk> buried under the ashes of a terrible time <unk> nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> knew about this article of competition, but I avoided <unk> at the work of his own work.
There was not even one translation in English, but luckily, the <unk> husband was German -- and he <unk> him for her.
The document gives a new story of autism.
Her author was a man named Hans <unk> who ran a integrated clinic with a school school in Vienna in the 1930s.
The ideas of Asperger's for teaching children with learning differences were <unk> even for contemporary standards.
The morning in his clinic started with <unk> classes with music, and children kept their games on Sunday afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, Asperger's described as disability <unk> of life that required <unk> and <unk> spaces, over the course of all life.
Instead of treating children in their clinic like patients, while he called them their little teachers, and they got to help the development of education methods that were especially right to them.
<unk> has seen autism as a continuous continuum that included an amazing variety of gifts, and disability.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were common, and they have always been, seeing the aspects of this continuum in <unk> known in the pop culture as the awkward social scientist and Professor <unk>
He was more there even to say, that for success in science and art, a little bit of autism is essential.
<unk> and Judith found that <unk> was wrong in that autism was <unk> as well as parents were <unk>
Over the next few years, they worked in silence with the American American Association to expand the criteria of the diagnosis that reflect the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
By the end of the '80s and early '90s, their changes entered <unk> by using the limited model of <unk> by one wide and <unk>
These changes were completely stuck in a broken bag.
<unk> when <unk> and Judith worked between <unk> to reform these <unk> people around the world see an autistic adult for the first time.
Before I went out of <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a little circle, <unk> by experts knew what autism, but after the <unk> performance of <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> with four awards of <unk> <unk> psychologists, <unk> and fathers of the world knew what the autism.
At the same time, they were introduced to the first clinical clinics to use to diagnose autism.
I had no longer to have a connection with that little circle of experts to get a diagnosis for her son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes in the criteria and the introduction of these evidence created a network, a perfect storm of the awareness of autism.
The number of diagnoses started <unk> just like they predicted <unk> and <unk> in fact that they were waiting for people to go out with autism and their families finally <unk> the support and services that are <unk>
So Andrew <unk> came to blame vaccines for the increase in the <unk> a simple, powerful history -- and <unk> <unk> history as a <unk> theory was <unk>
If the current estimate of the prevention rate that one of 68 children in the United States are in the spectrum, is the right, the <unk> are one of the largest <unk> groups in the world.
Over the last few years, autistic people have joined the Internet to reject the idea that the puzzles are <unk> for the new medical advances -- <unk> the term <unk> to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
One way to understand <unk> is to think in terms of human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work with Windows doesn't mean it's <unk>
According to standards -- the normal human brain is easily <unk> social <unk> and it has a deficit care <unk>
Indeed, autistic people have a hard time to live in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still reaching <unk> who believed that <unk> for the most <unk> aspects of autism are found in understanding of teachers, employers with capacity, communities, communities, with faith in the potential of their children.
A autistic woman named <unk> <unk> once said, "We need all the hands on cover to <unk> the boat of <unk>
As we <unk> towards an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to address the challenges that we face as a society.
We can't afford to waste a brain.
Thank you.
